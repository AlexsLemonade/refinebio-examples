Briefly, data were imported in R, and normalized using the gcrma normalization. As data were obtained in 3 batches, a batch correction procedure (Johnson, W. E., C. Li, et al. 2007) was applied in order to homogenize the data.	15617	Heart samples from heart-amputated zebrafish 3 days post amputation.
