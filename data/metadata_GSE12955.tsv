Cells were sorted into lysis buffer directly, and total RNAs were extracted using Absolutely RNA Nanoprep Kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions.	GSM324903	Following fragmentation, 10 microg of cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Zebrafish Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Biotin	Biotinylated cRNA was generated by 2 round of in vitro transcription (IVT) using MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Applyied Biosystems).
