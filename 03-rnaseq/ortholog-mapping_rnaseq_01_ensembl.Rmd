# Purpose of this analysis

This notebook demonstrates how you can use data from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) database to perform ortholog mapping for RNA-seq data obtained from refine.bio.
In this notebook, we will use mouse data from refine.bio and annotate it with human Ensembl IDs from HGNC.

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/ortholog-mapping_rnaseq_01_ensembl.Rmd).

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)
Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

We are going to use non-quantile normalized data for this analysis.
To get this data, you will need to check the box that says "Skip quantile normalization for RNA-seq samples".
Note that this option will only be available for RNA-seq datasets.

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/skip-quantile-normalization.png" width=500>

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready. 

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [acute myeloid leukemia sample dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP070849/combination-targeted-therapy-to-disrupt-aberrant-oncogenic-signaling-and-reverse-epigenetic-dysfunction-in-idh2-and-tet2-mutant-acute-myeloid-leukemia-rna-seq).

The data that we downloaded from refine.bio for this analysis has 19 samples (obtained from 19 mouse models with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)), containing RNA-sequencing results for types of AML under controlled treatment conditions.
More specifically, IDH2-mutant AML mouse models were treated with either vehicle or AG-221 (the first small molecule in-vivo inhibitor of IDH2 to enter clinical trials).
While, the TET2-mutant AML mouse models were treated with vehicle or 5-Azacytidine (Decitabine, hypomethylating agent).

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `<experiment_accession_id>` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `SRP070849` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `SRP070849` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  

Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession id and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
Run this chunk to double check that your files are in the right place. 

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "SRP070849")

# Check if the gene expression matrix file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "SRP070849.tsv"))

# Check if the metadata file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "metadata_SRP070849.tsv"))
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

## Import data from HGNC

The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) assigns a unique and ideally meaningful name and symbol to every human gene.
The [HGNC database](https://www.genenames.org/) currently contains over 39000 public records containing approved human gene nomenclature and associated gene information [@Gray2015].

The [HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP)](https://www.genenames.org/tools/hcop/) is a search tool that combines orthology predictions for a specified human gene, or set of human genes, by eggNOG, Ensembl Compara, HGNC, HomoloGene, Inparanoid, NCBI Gene Orthology, OMA, OrthoDB, OrthoMCL, Panther, PhylomeDB, PomBase, TreeFam and ZFIN, allowing users to obtain and compare orthology data [@Wright2005].
The prediction with the most number of databases which concur is considered the most reliable.
HCOP was originally designed to show orthology predictions between human and mouse, but has been expanded to include data from 18 genomes [@hcop-help].

In the next chunk, we have adapted code from the [`hcop` package R script](https://github.com/stephenturner/hcop/blob/master/data-raw/hcop.R) to retrieve the mouse and human mapped data from the HGNC database [@Turner2018].

```{r}
# Define URL to desired organism ortholog mapping file from the HGNC database
mouse_hgnc_url <- paste0(
    "ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/genenames/hcop/",
    "human_",
    "mouse", # Replace with the organism you have data for; see the list of possible files from the HGNC at this link: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/genenames/hcop/
    "_hcop_fifteen_column.txt.gz"
  )
```

```{r}
# Read in the data from HGNC
mouse <- data.table::fread(mouse_hgnc_url) %>% # Here we use `data.table::fread()` instead of `readr::read_tsv()` because we expect this file to be large so the `fread()` function is faster/more efficient here
  set_names(names(.) %>%
  gsub("_gene$", "", .)) # Removing some extra wording in some of the column names
```

Let's take a look at what `mouse` looks like.

```{r}
mouse
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file. 
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your metadata file
  "metadata_SRP070849.tsv" # Replace with the name of your metadata file
))

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your data file
  "SRP070849.tsv" # Replace with the name of your data file
)) %>%
  # Tuck away the gene ID column as rownames
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order. 

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(metadata$refinebio_accession_code)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), metadata$refinebio_accession_code)

# Bring back the "Gene" column in preparation for mapping
df <- df %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Gene")
```

## Mapping mouse Ensembl gene IDs to human Ensembl gene IDs

refine.bio data uses Ensembl gene identifiers, which will be in the first column.

```{r}
# Let's take a look at the first 6 items in the `Gene` column of `df`
head(df$Gene)
```

Ensembl gene identifiers have different species-specific prefixes. 
In mouse, Ensembl gene identifiers begin with `ENSMUSG` (in human, `ENSG`, etc.).

Now let's do the mapping!

We're interested in the `human_ensembl`, `mouse_ensembl`, and `support` columns specifically.
The `support` column contains a list of associated databases that support each assertion.
This column may assist with addressing some of the multi-mappings that we will talk about later.

```{r}
human_mouse_key <- mouse %>%
  # We'll want to subset mouse to only the columns we're interested in
  dplyr::select(mouse_ensembl, human_ensembl, support)

# Since we ignored the additional columns in `mouse`, let's check to see if we have any duplicates in our `human_mouse_key`
any(duplicated(human_mouse_key))
```

We do have duplicates!
We don't want to handle duplicate data, so let's remove those duplicates before moving forward.

```{r}
human_mouse_key <- human_mouse_key %>%
  # We need to use the `distinct()` function to remove duplicates resulted from ignoring the additional columns in the `mouse` object
  dplyr::distinct()
```

Now let's join the mapped data from `human_mouse_key` with the expression data in `df`.

```{r}
human_mouse_mapped_df <- df %>%
  dplyr::left_join(human_mouse_key, by = c("Gene" = "mouse_ensembl")) %>%
  # Sort so that the columns with the mouse Ensembl IDs and human Ensembl IDs are first
  dplyr::select(Gene, human_ensembl, dplyr::everything())
```

Here's what the new data frame looks like:

```{r}
head(human_mouse_mapped_df, n = 25)
```

Let's get a summary of the Ensembl IDs returned in the `human_ensembl` column of our mapped data frame.

```{r}
# We can use this `count()` function after `group_by()`to get a count of how many `mouse_ensembl` IDs there are per `human_ensembl` IDs
human_mouse_mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::group_by(human_ensembl) %>%
  dplyr::count() %>%
  # Sort by highest `n` which would be the human Ensembl ID with the most mapped mouse Ensembl IDs
  dplyr::arrange(desc(n))
```

Looks like we have mapped IDs!
Now, let's get an idea of how many mouse Ensembl IDs we have that were not mapped to human Ensembl IDs.

```{r}
sum(is.na(human_mouse_mapped_df$human_ensembl))
```

We have 18801 NAs, which means we have 18801 mouse Ensembl IDs that were not mapped to human Ensembl IDs.
This is okay because we do not expect everything to map across species.

## Take a look at some multi-mappings

If a mouse Ensembl gene ID maps to multiple human Ensembl IDs, the gene expression values get duplicated.
Let's look at the `ENSMUSG00000000290` example below.

```{r}
human_mouse_mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(Gene == "ENSMUSG00000000290")
```

Remember that our original data is associated to mouse Ensembl IDs, so when a human Ensembl ID maps to multiple mouse Ensembl IDs, the data will not get duplicated, but you will have multiple rows associated with that human symbol.
Let's look at the `CACNA1B` example below.

```{r}
human_mouse_mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(human_ensembl == "CACNA1B")
```

## Collapse multi-mapped human Ensembl IDs

Remember that if a mouse Ensembl gene ID maps to multiple human symbols, the gene expression values get duplicated.
We can collapse the multi-mapped values into a list for each Ensembl ID as to not have duplicate expression values in our data frame.

In the next chunk, we show how we can collapse all the human Ensembl IDs into one column where we store them all for each unique mouse Ensembl ID.

```{r}
collapsed_human_ensembl_df <- human_mouse_mapped_df %>%
  # Group by Ensembl IDs
  dplyr::group_by(Gene) %>%
  # Collapse the mapped values in `human_mouse_mapped_df` into one column named `all_human_ensembls`
  dplyr::summarize(all_human_ensembls = paste(human_ensembl, collapse = ";")) %>%
  # Now we need get the gene expression data back
  dplyr::left_join(df, by = "Gene")

head(collapsed_human_ensembl_df)
```

### Write results to file

Now let's write our results to file.

```{r}
readr::write_tsv(
  collapsed_human_ensembl_df,
  file.path(
    results_dir,
    "SRP070849_mouse_ensembl_to_collapsed_human_gene_symbol.tsv" # Replace with a relevant output file name
  )
)
```

## Collapse multi-mapped mouse Ensembl IDs

Since multiple mouse Ensembl gene IDs map to the same human symbol, we can also collapse all Ensembl IDs that each unique human Ensembl ID mapped to.

A known issue in ortholog mapping is how to handle this data because combining values across mouse transcripts using an average may result in the loss of a lot of data and will likely not be representative of the mouse biology.
Therefore, we will not add the expression data here since the expression values are not the same across Ensembl IDs, despite mapping to the same human Ensembl ID.

Instead, we will use the `support` column to decide which mappings to retain.
As we noted earlier, the prediction with the most number of databases which concur is considered the most reliable.
Therefore, where we have multi-mapped mouse Ensembl gene IDs, we will take the mapping with the most databases that concur according to the `support` column.

```{r}
filtered_mouse_ensembl_df <- human_mouse_mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(n_databases = stringr::str_count(support, ",") + 1) %>% # Count the number of databases in the support column for each prediction
  dplyr::group_by(human_ensembl) %>% # Group by human Ensembl IDs
  dplyr::filter(n_databases == max(n_databases)) # Now filter for the row with the largest number of databases in support for each human Ensembl ID

head(filtered_mouse_ensembl_df)
```

### Write results to file

Now let's write our list of collapsed mouse Ensembl IDs for each unique human Ensembl ID to file.

```{r}
readr::write_tsv(
  filtered_mouse_ensembl_df,
  file.path(
    results_dir,
    "SRP070849_filtered_mouse_ensembl_to_human_gene_symbol_list.tsv" # Replace with a relevant output file name
  )
)
```
