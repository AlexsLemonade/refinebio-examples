## Introduction to RNA-seq technology

### Further reading about RNA-seq technologies 

## About DESeq2

### Why we use DESeq2
- Plays nicely with tximport which refinebio uses
- It includes a lot of functions that can perform all your basic differential expression needs. 

### DESeq2 normalization 
- How do we get QN'ed vs non-QN'ed from refinebio
- Compare and contrast the normalization methods (QN'ed by us vs VST vs rlog vs ???)
- How did we choose which normalization method to use in each tutorial example?
