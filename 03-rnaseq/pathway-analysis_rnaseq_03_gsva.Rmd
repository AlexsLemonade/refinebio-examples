**IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (except microarray -> rna-seq)

# Purpose of this analysis

This example is one of pathway analysis module set, we recommend looking at the [pathway analysis table below](#how-to-choose-a-pathway-analysis) to help you determine which pathway analysis method is best suited for your purposes.

In this example we will cover a method called Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) to calculate gene set or pathway scores on a per-sample basis.
Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology.
Rather than contextualizing some results you have received from another analysis like DGE, GSVA is designed to provide an estimate of pathway variation for each of the samples in an experiment.
This means that GSVA scores will depend on the samples included in the dataset when you run GSVA; if you added more samples and ran GSVA again, you would expect the scores to change [@Hanzelmann2013].

GSVA determines the relative enrichment of gene sets across samples using a non-parametric approach.
GSVA transforms a gene by sample gene expression matrix into a gene set by sample pathway enrichment matrix [@Hanzelmann-github].
You can use these scores for other downstream analyses; in this analysis we will perform differential expression to determine what pathway is most different across our variable of interest.

### What is pathway analysis?

Pathway analysis refers to any one of many techniques that uses predetermined sets of genes that are related or coordinated in their expression in some way (e.g., participate in the same molecular process, are regulated by the same transcription factor) to interpret a high-throughput experiment.
In the context of [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we use these techniques to analyze and interpret genome-wide gene expression experiments.
The rationale for performing pathway analysis is that looking at the pathway-level may be more biologically meaningful than considering individual genes, especially if a large number of genes are differentially expressed between conditions of interest.
In addition, many relatively small changes in the expression values of genes in the same pathway could lead to a phenotypic outcome and these small changes may go undetected in differential gene expression analysis.

We highly recommend taking a look at [Ten Years of Pathway Analysis: Current Approaches and Outstanding Challenges](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002375) from @Khatri2012 for a more comprehensive overview. We have provided primary publications and documentation of the methods we will introduce below as well as some recommended reading in the [`Resources for further learning` section](#resources-for-further-learning).

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/pathway-analysis_rnaseq_03_gsva.Rmd).

Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

**IDENTICAL TO WGCNA**

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [acute viral bronchiolitis  dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP140558).
The data that we downloaded from refine.bio for this analysis has 62 paired peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA-seq samples obtained from 31 patients.
Samples were collected at two time points: during their first, acute bronchiolitis visit (abbreviated "AV") and their recovery, their post-convalescence visit (abbreviated "CV").

**IDENTICAL TO TEMPLATE** (Except links changed)

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `SRP140558` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `SRP140558` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `SRP140558` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  

Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession ID and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
These chunks will declare your file paths and double check that your files are in the right place. 

First we will declare our file paths to our data and metadata files, which should be in our data directory.
This is handy to do because if we want to switch the dataset (see next section for more on this) we are using for this analysis, we will only have to change the file path here to get started.  

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "SRP140558") # Replace with accession number which will be the name of the folder the files will be in

# Declare the file path to the gene expression matrix file using the data directory saved as `data_dir`
data_file <- file.path(data_dir, "SRP140558.tsv") # Replace with file path to your dataset

# Declare the file path to the metadata file using the data directory saved as `data_dir`
metadata_file <- file.path(data_dir, "metadata_SRP140558.tsv") # Replace with file path to your metadata
```

Now that our file paths are declared, we can use the `file.exists()` function to check that the files are where we specified above.  

```{r}
# Check if the gene expression matrix file is at the file path stored in `data_file`
file.exists(data_file)

# Check if the metadata file is at the file path stored in `metadata_file`
file.exists(metadata_file)
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

**IDENTICAL TO MICROARRRAY GSVA** (Except DESeq2 package added)

# Gene set variation analysis - RNAA-Seq

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

We will be using `DESeq2` to normalize and transform our RNA-seq data before running GSVA, so we will need to install that [@Love2014].

In this analysis, we will be using the [`GSVA`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html) package to perform GSVA and the [`qusage`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qusage.html) package to read in the GMT file containing the gene set data [@Hanzelmann2013; @Yaari2013].

We will also need the [`org.Hs.eg.db`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html) package to perform gene identifier conversion [@Carlson2020-human].

We'll also be performing differential expression test on our GSVA scores, and for that we will use `limma` [@Ritchie2015] and we'll make a sina plot of the scores of our most significant pathway using a ggplot2 companion package, `ggforce`.

```{r}
if (!("GSVA" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("GSVA", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("qusage" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("qusage", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("org.Hs.eg.db" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("limma" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("limma", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("ggforce" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  install.packages("ggforce")
}
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis.

```{r}
# Attach the DESeq2 library
library(DESeq2)

# Attach the `qusage` library
library(qusage)

# Attach the `GSVA` library
library(GSVA)

# Human annotation package we'll use for gene identifier conversion
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

# Attach the ggplot2 package for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)
```

**NEARLY IDENTICAL TO WGCNA** (except WGCNA references removed) 

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file.
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

We stored our file paths as objects named `metadata_file` and `data_file` in [this previous step](#check-out-our-file-structure).

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(metadata_file)

# Read in data TSV file
expression_df <- readr::read_tsv(data_file) %>%
  # Here we are going to store the gene IDs as rownames so that we can have a numeric matrix to perform calculations on later
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order.

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
expression_df <- expression_df %>%
  dplyr::select(metadata$refinebio_accession_code)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(expression_df), metadata$refinebio_accession_code)
```

### Prepare data for `DESeq2`

There are two things we need to do to prep our expression data for DESeq2. 

First, we need to make sure all of the values in our data are converted to integers as required by a `DESeq2` function we will use later.

Then, we need to filter out the genes that have not been expressed or that have low expression counts. 
Removing low count genes can also help improve results. 
We are going to do some pre-filtering to keep only genes with 50 or more reads in total across the samples.

```{r}
# The next DESeq2 functions need the values to be converted to integers
expression_df <- round(expression_df) %>%
  # The next steps require a data frame and round() returns a matrix
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # Only keep rows that have total counts above the cutoff
  dplyr::filter(rowSums(.) >= 50)
```

Another thing we need to do is set up our main experimental group variable. 
Unfortunately the metadata for this dataset are not set up into separate, neat columns, but we can accomplish that ourselves. 

For this study, PBMCs were collected at two time points: during the patients' first, acute bronchiolitis visit (abbreviated "AV") and their recovery visit, (called post-convalescence and abbreviated "CV").

For handier use of this information, we can create a new variable, `time_point`, that states this info more clearly. 
This new `time_point` variable will have two labels: `acute illness` and `recovering` based on the `AV` or `CV` coding located in the `refinebio_title` string variable. 

```{r}
metadata <- metadata %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    time_point = dplyr::case_when(
      # Create our new variable based on refinebio_title containing AV/CV
      stringr::str_detect(refinebio_title, "_AV_") ~ "acute illness",
      stringr::str_detect(refinebio_title, "_CV_") ~ "recovering"
    ),
    # It's easier for future items if this is already set up as a factor
    time_point = as.factor(time_point)
  )
```

Let's double check that our factor set up is right. 
We want `acute illness` to be the first level since it was the first time point collected. 

```{r}
levels(metadata$time_point)
```

Great! We're all set. 

## Create a DESeqDataset

We will be using the `DESeq2` package for [normalizing and transforming our data](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/00-intro-to-rnaseq.html#deseq2-transformation-methods), which requires us to format our data into a `DESeqDataSet` object.
We turn the data frame (or matrix) into a [`DESeqDataSet` object](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/00-intro-to-rnaseq.html#02_About_DESeq2) and specify which variable labels our experimental groups using the [`design` argument](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#multi-factor-designs) [@Love2014].
In this chunk of code, we will not provide a specific model to the `design` argument because we are not performing a differential expression analysis.

```{r}
# Create a `DESeqDataSet` object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
  countData = expression_df, # Our prepped data frame with counts
  colData = metadata, # Data frame with annotation for our samples
  design = ~1 # Here we are not specifying a model
)
```

## Perform DESeq2 normalization and transformation

We often suggest normalizing and transforming your data for various applications including for GSVA. 
We are going to use the `vst()` function from the `DESeq2` package to normalize and transform the data.
For more information about these transformation methods, [see here](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/00-intro-to-rnaseq.html#deseq2-transformation-methods). 

```{r}
# Normalize and transform the data in the `DESeqDataSet` object using the `vst()`
# function from the `DESEq2` R package
dds_norm <- vst(dds)
```

At this point, if your data set has any outlier samples, you should look into removing them as they can affect your results. 
For this example data set, we will skip this step (there are no obvious outliers) and proceed.

Extract the normalized counts to a matrix and make it into a data frame so we can use with tidyverse functions later. 

```{r}
# Retrieve the normalized data from the `DESeqDataSet`
normalized_counts <- assay(dds_norm) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% # Make into a data frame
  tibble::rownames_to_column("ensembl_id") # Make Gene IDs into their own column
```

**IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA**

### Import Gene Sets

The function that we will use to run GSVA wants the gene sets to be in a list, rather than a tidy data frame.

We are therefore going to read in the Hallmark collection of gene sets file directly from [MSigDB](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp), rather than using the [`msigdbr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msigdbr/index.html) package like we did in earlier notebooks [@Igor2020].

Note that when reading in the Hallmark collection file in this manner, the data is only compatible with _Homo sapiens_ datasets.

```{r}
# R can often read in data from a URL
hallmarks_url <- "https://data.broadinstitute.org/gsea-msigdb/msigdb/release/7.2/h.all.v7.2.entrez.gmt"

# QuSAGE is another pathway analysis method, the `qusage` package has a function
# for reading GMT files and turning them into a list
hallmarks_list <- qusage::read.gmt(hallmarks_url)
```

What does this `hallmarks_list` look like?

```{r}
head(hallmarks_list)
```

Looks like we have a list of gene sets with associated Entrez IDs.

In our gene expression data frame, `expression_df` we have Ensembl gene identifiers.
So we will need to convert our Ensembl IDs into Entrez IDs for GSVA.

**IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (except `expression_df` -> `normalized_counts`)

### Gene identifier conversion

We're going to convert our identifiers in `expression_df` to Entrez IDs, but you can, with the change of a single argument, use the same code to convert to many other types of identifiers!

The annotation package `org.Hs.eg.db` contains information for different identifiers [@Carlson2020-human].
`org.Hs.eg.db` is specific to _Homo sapiens_ -- this is what the `Hs` in the package name is referencing.

We can see what types of IDs are available to us in an annotation package with `keytypes()`.

```{r}
keytypes(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

Even though we'll use this package to convert from Ensembl gene IDs (`ENSEMBL`) to Entrez IDs (`ENTREZID`), we could just as easily use it to convert from an Ensembl transcript ID (`ENSEMBLTRANS`) to gene symbols (`SYMBOL`).

Take a look at our other gene identifier conversion examples for examples with different species and gene ID types:
[the microarray example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/gene-id-annotation_rnaseq_01_ensembl.html) and [the RNA-seq example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/gene-id-annotation_rnaseq_01_ensembl.html).

The function we will use to map from Ensembl gene IDs to Entrez gene IDs is called `mapIds()`.

Let's create a data frame that shows the mapped Entrez IDs along with the gene expression values for the respective Ensembl IDs.

```{r}
# First let's create a mapped data frame we can join to the gene expression values
mapped_df <- data.frame(
  "entrez_id" = mapIds(
    org.Hs.eg.db, # Replace with annotation package for the organism relevant to your data
    keys = normalized_counts$ensembl_id,
    column = "ENTREZID", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers you would like to map to
    keytype = "ENSEMBL", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers in your data
    multiVals = "first" # This will keep only the first mapped value for each Ensembl ID
  )
) %>%
  # If an Ensembl gene identifier doesn't map to a Entrez gene identifier, drop that
  # from the data frame
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(entrez_id)) %>%
  # Make an `Ensembl` column to store the row names
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Ensembl") %>%
  # Now let's join the rest of the expression data
  dplyr::inner_join(normalized_counts, by = c("Ensembl" = "ensembl_id"))
```

This `1:many mapping between keys and columns` message means that some Ensembl gene identifiers map to multiple Entrez IDs.
In this case, it's also possible that a Entrez ID will map to multiple Ensembl IDs.
For the purpose of performing GSVA later in this notebook, we keep only the first mapped IDs.
For more about how to explore this, take a look at our [microarray gene ID conversion example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/gene-id-annotation_rnaseq_01_ensembl.html).

Let's see a preview of `mapped_df`.

```{r}
head(mapped_df)
```

We will want to keep in mind that GSVA requires that data is in a matrix with the gene identifiers as row names.
In order to successfully turn our data frame into a matrix, we will need to ensure that we do not have any duplicate gene identifiers.

Let's check to see if we have any Entrez IDs that mapped to multiple Ensembl IDs.

```{r}
any(duplicated(mapped_df$entrez_id))
```

Looks like we do have duplicated Entrez IDs.
Let's find out which Entrez IDs have been duplicated.

```{r}
dup_entrez_ids <- mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(duplicated(entrez_id)) %>%
  dplyr::pull(entrez_id)

dup_entrez_ids
```

**STILL mostly IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (except data refs changed and only one entrez id data shown)

#### Handling duplicate gene identifiers

As we mentioned earlier, we will not want any duplicate gene identifiers in our data frame when we convert it into a matrix in preparation for the GSVA steps later.
GSVA is executed on a per sample basis so let's keep the maximum expression value per sample associated with the duplicate Entrez gene identifiers.
In other words, we will keep only the maximum expression value found across the duplicate Entrez gene identifier instances for each sample or column in this case.

Let's take a look at the one of rows associated with the duplicated Entrez IDs and see how this will play out. 

```{r}
mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(entrez_id %in% dup_entrez_ids[1])
```

As an example using the strategy we described, for `SRR7011789`'s data in the first column, `4.264957` is larger than `4.099752` so moving forward, Entrez gene `6013` will have `4.264957` value and the `4.099752` would be dropped from the dataset. 
However, this is just one method of handling duplicate gene identifiers.
See the [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) User guide](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html) for more information on other expression values that can be used, like the median expression value for example [@GSEA-user-guide].
Now, let's implement our choose the max value method for all samples and Entrez IDs using tidyverse functions. 

```{r}
max_dup_df <- mapped_df %>%
  # We won't be using Ensembl IDs moving forward, so we will drop this column
  dplyr::select(-Ensembl) %>%
  # Filter to include only the rows associated with the duplicate Entrez gene identifiers
  dplyr::filter(entrez_id %in% dup_entrez_ids) %>%
  # Group by Entrez IDs
  dplyr::group_by(entrez_id) %>%
  # Get the maximum expression value using all values associated with each duplicate
  # Entrez ID for each column or sample in this case
  dplyr::summarize_all(max)

max_dup_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(entrez_id %in% dup_entrez_ids[1])
```

We can see `SRR7011789` now has the `4.264957` value for Entrez ID `6013` like expected. 
Looks like we were able to successfully get rid of the duplicate Entrez gene identifiers!

Now let's combine our de-duplicated data with the rest of the mapped data!

```{r}
filtered_mapped_df <- mapped_df %>%
  # We won't be using Ensembl IDs moving forward, so we will drop this column
  dplyr::select(-Ensembl) %>%
  # First let's get the data associated with the Entrez gene identifiers that aren't duplicated
  dplyr::filter(!entrez_id %in% dup_entrez_ids) %>%
  # Now let's bind the rows of the maximum expression data we stored in `max_dup_df`
  dplyr::bind_rows(max_dup_df)
```

As mentioned earlier, we need a matrix for GSVA.
Let's now convert our data frame into a matrix and prepare our object for GSVA.

```{r}
filtered_mapped_matrix <- filtered_mapped_df %>%
  # We need to store our gene identifiers as row names
  tibble::column_to_rownames("entrez_id") %>%
  # Now we can convert our object into a matrix
  as.matrix()
```

Note that if we had duplicate gene identifiers here, we would not be able to set them as row names.

## GSVA - Microarray

Rather than ranking genes based on some gene-level statistic selected by the user, GSVA fits a model and ranks genes based on their expression level relative to the sample distribution.
The pathway-level score calculated is a way of asking how genes _within_ a gene set vary as compared to genes that are _outside_ of that gene set [@Malhotra2018].

The idea here is that we will get pathway-level scores for each sample that indicate if genes in a pathway vary concordantly in one direction (over-expressed or under-expressed relative to the overall population) [@Hanzelmann2013].

The output is a gene set by sample matrix of GSVA scores.


**STILL mostly IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA**

### Perform GSVA

Let's perform GSVA using the `gsva()` function.
See `?gsva` for more options.

```{r}
gsva_results <- gsva(
  filtered_mapped_matrix,
  hallmarks_list,
  method = "gsva",
  # Appropriate for our normalized counts data
  kcdf = "Gaussian",
  # Minimum gene set size
  min.sz = 15,
  # Maximum gene set size
  max.sz = 500,
  # Compute Gaussian-distributed scores
  mx.diff = TRUE,
  # Don't print out the progress bar
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

Here we are using `kcdf = "Poisson"` because we are using normalized and transformed counts. 

Let's explore what the output of `gsva()` looks like.

```{r}
head(gsva_results[, 1:10])
```

**STILL mostly IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (except dataset changed and no contrast matrix needed)

## Find differentially expressed pathways

If we want to identify most differentially expressed pathways across time points, we can use functionality in the `limma` package to test the GSVA scores.
This is one approach for working with GSVA scores.
The `mx.diff = TRUE` argument that we supplied to the `gsva()` function in the previous section means the GSVA output scores should be normally distributed, which allows downstream analyses that make this assumption about the distribution [@Hanzelmann-gsva-vignette].

### Create the design matrix

`limma` needs a numeric design matrix to signify which samples are from which time points.
Now we will create a model matrix based on our `time_point` variable.
We are using a `+ 0` in the model which sets the intercept to 0 so the time point effects capture expression for that group, rather than difference from the first group.
If you have a control group, you might want that to be the intercept.

```{r}
# Create the design matrix
des_mat <- model.matrix(~ metadata$time_point + 0)
```

Let's take a look at the design matrix we created.

```{r}
# Print out the design matrix
head(des_mat)
```

The design matrix column names are a bit messy, so we will neaten them up by dropping the `metadata$time_point` designation they all have and for being able to reference them easily later, we want to drop spaces as well. 

```{r}
# Make the column names less messy
colnames(des_mat) <- stringr::str_remove(colnames(des_mat), "metadata\\$time_point")

# Do a similar thing but remove spaces in names
colnames(des_mat) <- stringr::str_remove(colnames(des_mat), " ")
```

Side note: If you are wondering why there are two `\` above in `"filtered_metadata\\$time_point"`, that's called an [escape character](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/regular-expressions.html#escaping).
There's a whole universe of things called [regular expressions (regex)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/regular-expressions.html) that can be super handy for string manipulations.

## Perform differential expression on pathway scores

Run the linear model on each pathway (each row of `gsva_results`).

```{r}
# Apply linear model to data
fit <- limma::lmFit(gsva_results, design = des_mat)

# Apply empirical Bayes to smooth standard errors
fit <- limma::eBayes(fit)
```

Now that we have our basic model fitting, we will want to make the contrasts among all our groups.
Depending on your scientific questions, you will need to customize the next steps.
Consulting the [limma users guide](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf) for how to set up your model based on your hypothesis is a good idea.

Here's a [nifty article and example](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical_bayes_baseball/) about what the empirical Bayes smoothing is for [@bayes-estimates].

Now let's create the results table based on the contrasts fitted model.

This step will provide the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction.
The `topTable()` function default is to use Benjamini-Hochberg but this can be changed to a different method using the `adjust.method` argument (see the `?topTable` help page for more about the options).

```{r}
# Apply multiple testing correction and obtain stats
stats_df <- topTable(fit, number = nrow(normalized_counts)) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Gene")
```

Let's take a peek at our results table.

```{r}
head(stats_df)
```

For each gene, each group's fold change in expression, compared to the average of the other groups is reported.

By default, results are ordered from largest `F` value to the smallest, which means your most differentially expressed genes across all groups should be toward the top.

This means `HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION` appears to be the pathway that contains the most significant distribution of scores across time points. 

**STILL mostly IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (except pathway changed to `HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION`)

## Visualizing Results

Let's make a plot for our most significant pathway, `HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION`.

### Sina plot

First we need to get our GSVA scores for this pathway into a long data frame, an appropriate format for `ggplot2`.

Let's look at the current format of `gsva_results`.

```{r}
head(gsva_results[, 1:10])
```

We can see that they are in a wide format with the gsva scores for each sample spread across a row associated with each pathway.

Now let's convert these results into a data frame and into a long format, using the `tidyr::pivot_longer()` function.

```{r}
annotated_results_df <- gsva_results %>%
  # Make this into a data frame
  data.frame() %>%
  # Gene set names are row names
  tibble::rownames_to_column("pathway") %>%
  # Get into long format using the `tidyr::pivot_longer()` function
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = -pathway,
    names_to = "sample",
    values_to = "gsva_score"
  )

# Preview the annotated results object
head(annotated_results_df)
```

Now let's filter to include only the scores associated with our most significant pathway, `HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION`, and join the relevant group labels from the metadata for plotting. 

```{r}
top_pathway_annotated_results_df <- annotated_results_df %>%
  # Filter for only scores associated with our most significant pathway
  dplyr::filter(pathway == "HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION") %>%
  # Join the column with the group labels that we would like to plot and compare --
  # Select the variables relevant to your data
  dplyr::left_join(metadata %>% dplyr::select(
    refinebio_accession_code,
    time_point
  ),
  # Tell the join what columns are equivalent and should be used as a key
  by = c("sample" = "refinebio_accession_code")
  )

# Preview the filtered annotated results object
head(top_pathway_annotated_results_df)
```

Now let's make a sina plot so we can look at the differences between the `time_point` groups using our GSVA scores.

```{r}
# Sina plot comparing GSVA scores for `HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION` the `time_point` groups in our dataset
sina_plot <-
  ggplot(
    top_pathway_annotated_results_df, # Supply our annotated data frame
    aes(
      x = time_point, # Replace with a grouping variable relevant to your data
      y = gsva_score, # Column we created to store the GSVA scores in the last chunk
      color = time_point # Let's make the groups different colors too
    )
  ) +
  # Add a boxplot that will have summary stats
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  # Make a sina plot that shows individual values
  ggforce::geom_sina() +
  # Rename the y-axis label
  labs(y = "HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION score") +
  # Adjust the plot background for better visualization
  theme_bw()

# Display plot
sina_plot
```

Looks like the `acute illness` samples have higher GSVA scores for `HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION` as compared to the `recovering` samples.

Let's save this plot to PNG.

```{r}
ggsave(file.path(plots_dir, "SRP140558_gsva_HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION_sina_plot.png"),
  plot = sina_plot
)
```

## Write results to file

Now let's write all of our GSVA results to file.

```{r}
gsva_results %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("pathway") %>%
  readr::write_tsv(file.path(
    results_dir,
    "SRP140558_gsva_results.tsv"
  ))
```
