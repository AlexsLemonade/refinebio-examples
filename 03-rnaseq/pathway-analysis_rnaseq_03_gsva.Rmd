**IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (except microarray -> rna-seq)

# Purpose of this analysis

This example is one of pathway analysis module set, we recommend looking at the [pathway analysis table below](#how-to-choose-a-pathway-analysis) to help you determine which pathway analysis method is best suited for your purposes.

In this example we will cover a method called Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) to calculate gene set or pathway scores on a per-sample basis.
Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology.
Rather than contextualizing some results you have received from another analysis like DGE, GSVA is designed to provide an estimate of pathway variation for each of the samples in an experiment.
This means that GSVA scores will depend on the samples included in the dataset when you run GSVA; if you added more samples and ran GSVA again, you would expect the scores to change [@Hanzelmann2013].

GSVA determines the relative enrichment of gene sets across samples using a non-parametric approach.
GSVA transforms a gene by sample gene expression matrix into a gene set by sample pathway enrichment matrix [@Hanzelmann-github].
You can use these scores for other downstream analyses; in this analysis we will perform differential expression to determine what pathway is most different across our variable of interest.

### What is pathway analysis?

Pathway analysis refers to any one of many techniques that uses predetermined sets of genes that are related or coordinated in their expression in some way (e.g., participate in the same molecular process, are regulated by the same transcription factor) to interpret a high-throughput experiment.
In the context of [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we use these techniques to analyze and interpret genome-wide gene expression experiments.
The rationale for performing pathway analysis is that looking at the pathway-level may be more biologically meaningful than considering individual genes, especially if a large number of genes are differentially expressed between conditions of interest.
In addition, many relatively small changes in the expression values of genes in the same pathway could lead to a phenotypic outcome and these small changes may go undetected in differential gene expression analysis.

We highly recommend taking a look at [Ten Years of Pathway Analysis: Current Approaches and Outstanding Challenges](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002375) from @Khatri2012 for a more comprehensive overview. We have provided primary publications and documentation of the methods we will introduce below as well as some recommended reading in the [`Resources for further learning` section](#resources-for-further-learning).

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/pathway-analysis_rnaseq_03_gsva.Rmd).

Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

**IDENTICAL TO WGCNA**

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [acute viral bronchiolitis dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP140558).
The data that we downloaded from refine.bio for this analysis has 62 paired peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA-seq samples obtained from 31 patients.
Samples were collected at two time points: during their first, acute bronchiolitis visit (abbreviated "AV") and their recovery, their post-convalescence visit (abbreviated "CV").

**IDENTICAL TO TEMPLATE** (Except links changed)

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `SRP140558` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `SRP140558` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `SRP140558` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  

Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession ID and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
These chunks will declare your file paths and double check that your files are in the right place. 

First we will declare our file paths to our data and metadata files, which should be in our data directory.
This is handy to do because if we want to switch the dataset (see next section for more on this) we are using for this analysis, we will only have to change the file path here to get started.  

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "SRP140558") # Replace with accession number which will be the name of the folder the files will be in

# Declare the file path to the gene expression matrix file using the data directory saved as `data_dir`
data_file <- file.path(data_dir, "SRP140558.tsv") # Replace with file path to your dataset

# Declare the file path to the metadata file using the data directory saved as `data_dir`
metadata_file <- file.path(data_dir, "metadata_SRP140558.tsv") # Replace with file path to your metadata
```

Now that our file paths are declared, we can use the `file.exists()` function to check that the files are where we specified above.  

```{r}
# Check if the gene expression matrix file is at the file path stored in `data_file`
file.exists(data_file)

# Check if the metadata file is at the file path stored in `metadata_file`
file.exists(metadata_file)
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

**IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (Except DESeq2 package added)

# Gene set variation analysis - RNA-Seq

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

We will be using `DESeq2` to normalize and transform our RNA-seq data before running GSVA, so we will need to install that [@Love2014].

In this analysis, we will be using the [`GSVA`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html) package to perform GSVA and the [`qusage`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qusage.html) package to read in the GMT file containing the gene set data [@Hanzelmann2013; @Yaari2013].

We will also need the [`org.Hs.eg.db`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html) package to perform gene identifier conversion [@Carlson2020-human].

We'll create a heatmap from our pathway analysis results using `pheatmap` [@Slowikowski2017]

```{r}
if (!("DESeq2" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("DESeq2", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("GSVA" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("GSVA", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("qusage" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("qusage", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("org.Hs.eg.db" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("pheatmap" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install pheatmap
  install.packages("pheatmap", update = FALSE)
}
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis.

```{r}
# Attach the DESeq2 library
library(DESeq2)

# Attach the `qusage` library
library(qusage)

# Attach the `GSVA` library
library(GSVA)

# Human annotation package we'll use for gene identifier conversion
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)
```

**NEARLY IDENTICAL TO WGCNA** (except WGCNA references removed) 

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file.
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

We stored our file paths as objects named `metadata_file` and `data_file` in [this previous step](#check-out-our-file-structure).

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(metadata_file)

# Read in data TSV file
expression_df <- readr::read_tsv(data_file) %>%
  # Here we are going to store the gene IDs as rownames so that we can have a numeric matrix to perform calculations on later
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order.

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
expression_df <- expression_df %>%
  dplyr::select(metadata$refinebio_accession_code)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(expression_df), metadata$refinebio_accession_code)
```

### Prepare data for `DESeq2`

There are two things we need to do to prep our expression data for DESeq2. 

First, we need to make sure all of the values in our data are converted to integers as required by a `DESeq2` function we will use later.

Then, we need to filter out the genes that have not been expressed or that have low expression counts since we can not be as confident in those genes being reliably measured. 
We are going to do some pre-filtering to keep only genes with 50 or more reads in total across the samples.

```{r}
# The next DESeq2 functions need the values to be converted to integers
expression_df <- round(expression_df) %>%
  # The next steps require a data frame and round() returns a matrix
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # Only keep rows that have total counts above the cutoff
  dplyr::filter(rowSums(.) >= 50)
```

## Create a DESeqDataset

We will be using the `DESeq2` package for [normalizing and transforming our data](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/00-intro-to-rnaseq.html#deseq2-transformation-methods), which requires us to format our data into a `DESeqDataSet` object.
We turn the data frame (or matrix) into a [`DESeqDataSet` object](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/00-intro-to-rnaseq.html#02_About_DESeq2) and specify which variable labels our experimental groups using the [`design` argument](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#multi-factor-designs) [@Love2014].
In this chunk of code, we will not provide a specific model to the `design` argument because we are not performing a differential expression analysis.

```{r}
# Create a `DESeqDataSet` object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
  countData = expression_df, # Our prepped data frame with counts
  colData = metadata, # Data frame with annotation for our samples
  design = ~1 # Here we are not specifying a model
)
```

## Perform DESeq2 normalization and transformation

We often suggest normalizing and transforming your data for various applications including for GSVA. 
We are going to use the `vst()` function from the `DESeq2` package to normalize and transform the data.
For more information about these transformation methods, [see here](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/00-intro-to-rnaseq.html#deseq2-transformation-methods). 

```{r}
# Normalize and transform the data in the `DESeqDataSet` object using the `vst()`
# function from the `DESEq2` R package
dds_norm <- vst(dds)
```

At this point, if your data set has any outlier samples, you should look into removing them as they can affect your results. 
For this example data set, we will skip this step (there are no obvious outliers) and proceed.

But now we are ready to format our dataset for input into `gsva::gsva()`.
We need to extract the normalized counts to a matrix and make it into a data frame so we can use with tidyverse functions later. 

```{r}
# Retrieve the normalized data from the `DESeqDataSet`
normalized_counts <- assay(dds_norm) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% # Make into a data frame
  tibble::rownames_to_column("ensembl_id") # Make Gene IDs into their own column
```

**Review**

### Import Gene Sets

The function that we will use to run GSVA wants the gene sets to be in a list where each pathway has its own gene list inside of it. 

Here we are obtaining the pathway information from the main function of the [`msigdbr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msigdbr/index.html) package [@Igor2020].
Because we are using human data in this example, we supply the formal organism name to the `species` argument. 
We will want only the hallmark pathways, so we use the `category = "H"` argument.

```{r}
hallmark_gene_sets <- msigdbr::msigdbr(
  species = "Homo sapiens", # Can change this to what species you need
  category = "H" # Only hallmark genes
)
```

`hallmark_gene_sets` has which genes are a part of which pathway in a data frame format.
For this example we will use Entrez IDs (but note that there's gene symbols we could just as easily use).
The info we need is in two columns: `entrez_gene` contains the gene ID and `gs_name` contains the name of the pathway that the gene is a part of. 

To make this into the list format we need, we can use `split()` function.
Here we want `entrez_gene` to be made into smaller lists for each pathway.

```{r}
hallmarks_list <- split(
  hallmark_gene_sets$entrez_gene, # The genes we want split into lists
  hallmark_gene_sets$gs_name # The pathways made as the higher levels of the list
)
```

What does this `hallmarks_list` look like?

```{r}
head(hallmarks_list)
```

Looks like we have a list of gene sets with associated Entrez IDs.

In our gene expression data frame, `expression_df` we have Ensembl gene identifiers.
So we will need to convert our Ensembl IDs into Entrez IDs for GSVA.

**ALMOST IDENTICAL TO MICROARRAY GSVA** (A few wording rearrangements and `expression_df` -> `normalized_counts`)

### Gene identifier conversion

We're going to convert our identifiers in `expression_df` to Entrez IDs, but you can, with the change of a single argument, use the same code to convert to many other types of identifiers!

The annotation package `org.Hs.eg.db` contains information for different identifiers [@Carlson2020-human].
`org.Hs.eg.db` is specific to _Homo sapiens_ -- this is what the `Hs` in the package name is referencing.

We can see what types of IDs are available to us in an annotation package with `keytypes()`.

```{r}
keytypes(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

We' use this package to convert from Ensembl gene IDs (`ENSEMBL`) to Entrez IDs (`ENTREZID`) -- since this is the IDs we used in our `hallmarks_list` in the previous step. 
But, we could just as easily use it to convert from an Ensembl transcript ID (`ENSEMBLTRANS`) to gene symbols (`SYMBOL`) if we had built `hallmarks_list` using gene symbols. 

The function we will use to map from Ensembl gene IDs to Entrez gene IDs is called `mapIds()`.

Let's create a data frame that shows the mapped Entrez IDs along with the gene expression values for the respective Ensembl IDs.

```{r}
# First let's create a mapped data frame we can join to the gene expression values
mapped_df <- data.frame(
  "entrez_id" = mapIds(
    org.Hs.eg.db, # Replace with annotation package for the organism relevant to your data
    keys = normalized_counts$ensembl_id,
    column = "ENTREZID", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers you would like to map to
    keytype = "ENSEMBL", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers in your data
    multiVals = "first" # This will keep only the first mapped value for each Ensembl ID
  )
) %>%
  # If an Ensembl gene identifier doesn't map to a Entrez gene identifier, drop that
  # from the data frame
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(entrez_id)) %>%
  # Make an `Ensembl` column to store the row names
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Ensembl") %>%
  # Now let's join the rest of the expression data
  dplyr::inner_join(normalized_counts, by = c("Ensembl" = "ensembl_id"))
```

This `1:many mapping between keys and columns` message means that some Ensembl gene identifiers map to multiple Entrez IDs.
In this case, it's also possible that a Entrez ID will map to multiple Ensembl IDs.
For the purpose of performing GSVA later in this notebook, we keep only the first mapped IDs.

For more info on gene ID conversion, take a look at our other examples:
[the microarray example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/gene-id-annotation_rnaseq_01_ensembl.html) and [the RNA-seq example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/gene-id-annotation_rnaseq_01_ensembl.html).

Let's see a preview of `mapped_df`.

```{r}
head(mapped_df)
```

We will want to keep in mind that GSVA requires that data is in a matrix with the gene identifiers as row names.
In order to successfully turn our data frame into a matrix, we will need to ensure that we do not have any duplicate gene identifiers.

Let's count up how many Entrez IDs mapped to multiple Ensembl IDs.

```{r}
sum(duplicated(mapped_df$entrez_id))
```

Looks like we have 68 duplicated Entrez IDs.
