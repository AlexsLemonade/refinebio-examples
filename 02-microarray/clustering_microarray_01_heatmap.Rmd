# Purpose of this analysis

This notebook illustrates one way that you can use microarray data from refine.bio in downstream analyses, specifically in plotting clustered and annotated heatmaps.

⬇️ [**Jump to the analysis code**](#analysis) ⬇️

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before.

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/clustering_microarray_01_heatmap.Rmd).

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)
Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer.
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

## Set up your analysis folders

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you.
Run this next chunk to set up your folders!

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations.

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready.

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [melanoma cell line dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE24862).

The data that we downloaded from refine.bio for this analysis has 21 microarray samples.
The samples were obtained from three PLX4032-sensitive parental and three PLX4032-resistant sub-lines of melanoma cell lines that were either treated or not treated with the RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032.

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready.
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`.
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400>

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `<experiment_accession_id>` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`.

Copy and paste the `GSE24862` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain:

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `GSE24862` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  

Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession ID and analysis notebook name you are using):

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis.
Run this chunk to double check that your files are in the right place.

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "GSE24862")

# Check if the gene expression matrix file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "GSE24862.tsv"))

# Check if the metadata file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "metadata_GSE24862.tsv"))
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds).

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

# Clustering Heatmap - Microarray

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

In this analysis, we will be using the R package `pheatmap` for clustering and creating a heatmap [@Slowikowski2017].

```{r}
if (!("pheatmap" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install pheatmap
  install.packages("pheatmap", update = FALSE)
}
```

Attach the `pheatmap` library:

```{r}
# Attach the `pheatmap` library
library(pheatmap)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata [tab separated values (TSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) file and a data TSV file.
This chunk of code will read in both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your metadata file
  "metadata_GSE24862.tsv" # Replace with the name of your metadata file
))

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your data file
  "GSE24862.tsv" # Replace with the name of your data file
)) %>%
  # Here we are going to store the gene IDs as rownames so that we can have a numeric matrix to perform calculations on later
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's take a look at the metadata object that we read into the R environment.

```{r}
head(metadata)
```

Now let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order.

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>% dplyr::select(metadata$refinebio_accession_code)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), metadata$refinebio_accession_code)
```

Now we are going to use a combination of functions from base R and the `pheatmap` package to look at how our samples and genes are clustering.

## Choose genes of interest

Although you may want to create a heatmap including all of the genes in the set, alternatively, the heatmap could be created using only genes of interest.
For this example, we will sort genes by variance, but there are many alternative criterion by which you may want to sort your genes <i>e.g.</i> fold change, t-statistic, membership to a particular gene ontology, so on.

```{r}
# Calculate the variance for each gene
variances <- apply(df, 1, var)

# Determine the upper quartile variance cutoff value
upper_var <- quantile(variances, 0.75)

# Subset the data choosing only genes whose variances are in the upper quartile
df_by_var <- data.frame(df) %>%
  dplyr::filter(variances > upper_var)
```

## Create a heatmap

To further customize the heatmap, see a vignette for a guide at this [link](https://slowkow.com/notes/pheatmap-tutorial/) [@Slowikowski2017].

```{r}
# Create and store the heatmap object
heatmap <-
  pheatmap(
    df_by_var,
    cluster_rows = TRUE, # We want to cluster the heatmap by rows (genes in this case)
    cluster_cols = TRUE, # We also want to cluster the heatmap by columns (samples in this case),
    show_rownames = FALSE, # We don't want to show the rownames because there are too many genes for the labels to be clearly seen
    main = "Non-Annotated Heatmap",
    colorRampPalette(c(
      "deepskyblue",
      "black",
      "yellow"
    ))(25),
    scale = "row" # Scale values in the direction of genes (rows)
  )
```

We've created a heatmap but although our genes and samples are clustered, there is not much information that we can gather here because we did not provide the `pheatmap()` function with annotation labels for our samples.

First let's save our clustered heatmap.

### Save heatmap as a PNG

You can easily switch this to save to a JPEG or TIFF by changing the function and file name within the function to the respective file suffix.

```{r}
# Open a PNG file
png(file.path(
  plots_dir,
  "GSE24862_heatmap_non_annotated.png" # Replace file name with a relevant output plot name
))

# Print your heatmap
heatmap

# Close the PNG file:
dev.off()
```

Now, let's add some annotation bars to our heatmap.

## Prepare metadata for annotation

From the accompanying [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21107323/), we know that three PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines (M229, M238 and M249) and three derived PLX4032-resistant (r) sub-lines (M229_r5, M238_r1, and M249_r4) were treated or not treated with the RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032 [@Nazarian2010].
We are going to annotate our heatmap with the variables that hold the `refinebio_cell_line` and `refinebio_treatment` data.
We are also going to create a new column variable from our existing metadata called `cell_line_type`, that will distinguish whether the `refinebio_cell_line` is parental or resistant -- since this is also a key aspect of the experimental design.
Note that this step is very specific to our metadata, you may find that you also need to tailor the metadata for your own needs.

```{r}
# Let's prepare an annotation data frame for plotting
annotation_df <- metadata %>%
  # We want to select the variables that we want for annotating the heatmap
  dplyr::select(
    refinebio_accession_code,
    refinebio_cell_line,
    refinebio_treatment
  ) %>%
  # Let's create a variable that specifically distinguishes whether the cell line is parental or resistant -- since this is a key aspect of the experimental design
  dplyr::mutate(
    cell_line_type =
      dplyr::case_when(
        stringr::str_detect(refinebio_cell_line, "_r") ~ "resistant",
        TRUE ~ "parental"
      )
  ) %>%
  # The `pheatmap()` function requires that the row names of our annotation object matches the column names of our dataset object
  tibble::column_to_rownames("refinebio_accession_code")
```

### Create annotated heatmap

You can create an annotated heatmap by providing our annotation object to the `annotation_col` argument of the `pheatmap()` function.

```{r}
# Create and store the annotated heatmap object
heatmap_annotated <-
  pheatmap(
    df_by_var,
    cluster_rows = TRUE,
    cluster_cols = TRUE,
    show_rownames = FALSE,
    annotation_col = annotation_df,
    main = "Annotated Heatmap",
    colorRampPalette(c(
      "deepskyblue",
      "black",
      "yellow"
    ))(25),
    scale = "row" # Scale values in the direction of genes (rows)
  )
```

Now that we have annotation bars on our heatmap, we have a better idea of the cell line and treatment groups that appear to cluster together.
More specifically, we can see that the samples seem to cluster by their cell lines of origin, but not necessarily as much by whether or not they received the `PLX4302` treatment.

Let's save our annotated heatmap.

### Save annotated heatmap as a PNG

You can easily switch this to save to a JPEG or TIFF by changing the function and file name within the function to the respective file suffix.

```{r}
# Open a PNG file
png(file.path(
  plots_dir,
  "GSE24862_heatmap_annotated.png" # Replace file name with a relevant output plot name
))

# Print your heatmap
heatmap_annotated

# Close the PNG file:
dev.off()
```

# Print session info

At the end of every analysis, before saving your notebook, we recommend printing out your session info.
This helps make your code more reproducible by recording what versions of software and packages you used to run this.

```{r}
# Print session info
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
