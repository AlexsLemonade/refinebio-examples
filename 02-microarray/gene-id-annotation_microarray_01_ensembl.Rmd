# Purpose of this analysis

The purpose of this notebook is to provide an example of mapping gene IDs for microarray data obtained from refine.bio using `AnnotationDbi` packages.

⬇️ [**Jump to the analysis code**](#analysis) ⬇️

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/gene-id-convert_microarray_01_ensembl.Rmd).

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)
Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

For general information about downloading data for these examples, see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-the-data). 

Go to this [dataset's page on refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE13490/cancer-stem-cells-are-enriched-in-the-side-population-cells-in-a-mouse-model-of-glioma).

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready. 

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [mouse glioma stem cells dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE13490/cancer-stem-cells-are-enriched-in-the-side-population-cells-in-a-mouse-model-of-glioma).

This dataset has 15 microarray mouse glioma model samples.
The samples were obtained from parental biological replicates and from resistant sub-line biological replicates that were transplanted into recipient mice.

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `<experiment_accession_id>` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession IDs usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `GSE13490` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `GSE13490` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  
    
Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession ID and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
Run this chunk to double check that your files are in the right place. 

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "GSE13490")

# Check if the gene expression matrix file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "GSE13490.tsv"))

# Check if the metadata file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "metadata_GSE13490.tsv"))
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences. 

refine.bio data comes with gene level data with Ensembl IDs. 
Although this example notebook uses Ensembl IDs from Mouse, (<i>Mus musculus</i>), to obtain gene symbols this notebook can be easily converted for use with different species or annotation types <i>eg</i> protein IDs, gene ontology, accession numbers.

<b>For different species</b>, wherever the abbreviation `org.Mm.eg.db` or `Mm` is written, it must be replaced with the respective species abbreviation <i>eg</i> for<i> Homo sapiens</i> `org.Hs.eg.db` or `Hs` would be used.
In the case of our [RNA-seq gene identifier annotation example notebook](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/blob/master/03-rnaseq/gene-id-annotation_rnaseq_01_ensembl.html), a Zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) dataset is used, meaning `org.Dr.eg.db` or `Dr` would also need to be used there.
A full list of the annotation R packages from Bioconductor is at this [link](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___AnnotationData) [@annotation-packages].

# Obtaining Annotation for Ensembl IDs - Microarray

Ensembl IDs can be used to obtain various different annotations at the gene/transcript level.
Let's get ready to use the Ensembl IDs from our mouse dataset to obtain the associated gene symbols.

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

In this analysis, we will be using the `org.Mm.eg.db` R package [@Carlson2019].
[Other species can be used](#using-a-different-refinebio-dataset-with-this-analysis).

```{r}
# Install the mouse package
if (!("org.Mm.eg.db" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("org.Mm.eg.db", update = FALSE)
}
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis.

```{r}
# Attach the library
library(org.Mm.eg.db)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file. 
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your metadata file
  "metadata_GSE13490.tsv" # Replace with the name of your metadata file
))

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your data file
  "GSE13490.tsv" # Replace with the name of your data file
)) %>%
  # Tuck away the Gene ID column as rownames
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order. 

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(metadata$geo_accession)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), metadata$geo_accession)

# Bring back the "Gene" column in preparation for mapping
df <- df %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Gene")
```


## Map Ensembl IDs to gene symbols

The `mapIds()` function has a `multiVals` argument which denotes what to do when there are multiple mapped values for a single gene identifier.
The default behavior is to return just the first mapped value.
It is good to keep in mind that various downstream analyses may benefit from varied strategies at this step. 
Use `?mapIds` to see more options or strategies.

In the next chunk, we will run the `mapIds()` function and supply the `multiVals` argument with the `"list"` option in order to get a large list with all the mapped values found for each gene identifier.

```{r}
# Map ensembl IDs to their associated gene symbols
mapped_list <- mapIds(
  org.Mm.eg.db, # Replace with annotation package for the organism relevant to your data
  keys = df$Gene,
  column = "SYMBOL", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers you would like to map to
  keytype = "ENSEMBL", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers in your data
  multiVals = "list"
)
```

## Explore gene ID conversion

Now, let's take a look at our mapped object to see how the mapping went.

```{r}
# Let's use the `head()` function to take a preview at our mapped list
head(mapped_list)
```

It looks like we have gene symbols that were successfully mapped to the Ensembl IDs we provided.
However, the data is now in a `list` object, making it a little more difficult to explore.
We are going to turn our list object into a data frame object in the next chunk.

```{r}
# Let's make our object a bit more manageable for exploration by turning it into a data frame using the `reshape2::melt()` function
mapped_df <- mapped_list %>%
  reshape2::melt(value.name = "Symbol") %>%
  dplyr::rename("Ensembl" = "L1") # Here we are renaming the column holding the Ensembl IDs as good practice
```

Now let's take a peek at our data frame.

```{r}
head(mapped_df)
```

We can see that our data frame has a new column `Symbol`.
Let's get a summary of the gene symbols returned in the `Symbol` column of our mapped data frame.

```{r}
# We can use the `summary()` function to get a better idea of the distribution of symbols in the `Symbol` column
summary(mapped_df$Symbol)
```

There are 998 NA's in our data frame, which means that 998 out of the 17918 Ensembl IDs did not map to gene symbols.
998 out of 17918 is not too bad a rate, in our opinion, but note that different gene identifier types will have different mapping rates and that is to be expected.
Regardless, it is always good to be aware of how many genes you are potentially "losing" if you rely on this new gene identifier you've mapped to for downstream analyses.

However, if you have almost all NA's it is possible that the function was executed incorrectly or you may want to consider using a different gene identifier, if possible.

Now let's check to see if we have any genes that were mapped to multiple symbols.

```{r}
multi_mapped <- mapped_df %>%
  # Let's group by the Ensembl IDs in the `Ensembl` column
  dplyr::group_by(Ensembl) %>%
  # Create a new variable containing the number of symbols mapped to each ID
  dplyr::mutate(gene_symbol_count = dplyr::n()) %>%
  # Arrange by the genes with the highest number of symbols mapped
  dplyr::arrange(desc(gene_symbol_count)) %>%
  # Filter to include only the rows with multi mappings
  dplyr::filter(gene_symbol_count > 1)

# Let's look at the first 6 rows of our `multi_mapped` object
head(multi_mapped)
```

Looks like we have some cases where 3 gene symbols mapped to a single Ensembl ID.
We have a total of 130 out of 17984 Ensembl IDs with multiple mappings to gene symbols.
If we are not too worried about the 130 IDs with multiple mappings, we can filter them out for the purpose of having 1:1 mappings for our downstream analysis.

## Map Ensembl IDs to gene symbols -- filtering out multi mappings

The next code we chunk we will rerun the `mapIds()` function, this time supplying the `"filter"` option to the `multiVals` argument.
This will remove all instances of multiple mappings and return a list of only the gene identifiers and symbols that had 1:1 mapping.
Use `?mapIds` to see more options or strategies.

```{r}
# Map ensembl IDs to their associated gene symbols
filtered_mapped_df <- data.frame(
  "Symbol" = mapIds(
    org.Mm.eg.db, # Replace with annotation package for the organism relevant to your data
    keys = df$Gene,
    column = "SYMBOL", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers you would like to map to
    keytype = "ENSEMBL", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers in your data
    multiVals = "filter"
  )
)
```

Now, let's write our filtered and mapped results to file!

## Write mapped results to file

```{r Write to file}
# Write mapped and annotated data frame to output file
readr::write_tsv(filtered_mapped_df, file.path(
  results_dir,
  "GSE13490_Gene_Symbols.tsv" # Replace with a relevant output file name
))
```
