# Purpose of this analysis

This example is one of pathway analysis module set, we recommend looking at the [pathway analysis introduction](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/pathway-analysis_microarray_00_intro.html) to help you determine which pathway analysis method is best suited for your purposes.

In this example we will cover a method called Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) to calculate gene set or pathway scores on a per-sample basis.
Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology.
Rather than contextualizing some results you have received from another analysis like DGE, GSVA is designed to provide an estimate of pathway variation for each of the samples in an experiment.
This means that GSVA scores will depend on the samples included in the dataset when you run GSVA; if you added more samples and reran GSVA, you would expect the scores to change [@Hanzelmann2013].

GSVA determines the relative enrichment of gene sets across samples using
a non-parametric approach.
GSVA transforms a gene by sample gene expression matrix into a gene set by sample pathway enrichment matrix [@Hanzelmann-github].

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/pathway-analysis_microarray_03_gsva.Rmd).

Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready.

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [glioblastoma dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE7696/glioblastoma-from-a-homogenous-cohort-of-patients-treated-within-clinical-trial).

This dataset contains the measured microarray gene expression of 79 glioblastoma samples from a homogenous cohort of clinical patients.

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `GSE7696` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `GSE7696` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `GSE7696` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  

Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession ID and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
These chunks will declare your file paths and double check that your files are in the right place. 

First we will declare our file paths to our data and metadata files, which should be in our data directory.
This is handy to do because if we want to switch the dataset (see next section for more on this) we are using for this analysis, we will only have to change the file path here to get started.  

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "GSE7696") # Replace with accession number which will be the name of the folder the files will be in

# Declare the file path to the gene expression matrix file using the data directory saved as `data_dir`
data_file <- file.path(data_dir, "GSE7696.tsv") # Replace with file path to your dataset

# Declare the file path to the metadata file using the data directory saved as `data_dir`
metadata_file <- file.path(data_dir, "metadata_GSE7696.tsv") # Replace with file path to your metadata
```

Now that our file paths are declared, we can use the `file.exists()` function to check that the files are where we specified above.  

```{r}
# Check if the gene expression matrix file is at the file path stored in `data_file`
file.exists(data_file)

# Check if the metadata file is at the file path stored in `metadata_file`
file.exists(metadata_file)
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

# Gene set variation analysis - Microarray

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

In this analysis, we will be using the [`GSVA`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html) package to perform GSVA and the [`qusage`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qusage.html) package to read in the GMT file containing the gene set data [@Hanzelmann2013; @Meng2019].

We will also need the [`org.Hs.eg.db`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html) package to perform gene identifier conversion [@Carlson2020-human].

```{r}
if (!("GSVA" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("GSVA", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("qusage" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("qusage", update = FALSE)
}

if (!("org.Hs.eg.db" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db", update = FALSE)
}
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis.

```{r}
# Attach the `qusage` library
library(qusage)

# Attach the `GSVA` library
library(GSVA)

# Human annotation package we'll use for gene identifier conversion
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file. 
This chunk of code will read both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

We stored our file paths as objects named `metadata_file` and `data_file` in [this previous step](#check-out-our-file-structure).

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(metadata_file)

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(data_file) %>%
  # Tuck away the gene ID  column as row names
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order. 

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(metadata$geo_accession)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), metadata$geo_accession)

# Bring back the "Gene" column in preparation for mapping
df <- df %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Gene")
```

### Import Gene Sets

The function that we will use to run GSVA wants the gene sets to be in a list, rather than a tidy data frame that we used with `clusterProfiler` (although it does accept other formats).

We are therefore going to read in the Hallmark collection of gene sets file directly from [MSigDB](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp), rather than using the [`msigdbr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msigdbr/index.html) package like we did in earlier notebooks [@Igor2020].

Note that when reading in the Hallmark collection file in this manner, the data is only compatible with _Homo sapiens_ datasets.

```{r}
# R can often read in data from a URL
hallmarks_url <- "https://data.broadinstitute.org/gsea-msigdb/msigdb/release/7.2/h.all.v7.2.entrez.gmt"

# QuSAGE is another pathway analysis method, the `qusage` package has a function
# for reading GMT files and turning them into a list
hallmarks_list <- qusage::read.gmt(hallmarks_url)
```

What does this `hallmarks_list` look like?

```{r}
head(hallmarks_list)
```

Looks like we have a list of gene sets with associated Entrez IDs.

In our gene expression data frame, `df` we have Ensembl gene identifiers.
So we will need to convert our Ensembl IDs into Entrez IDs for GSVA.

### Gene identifier conversion

We're going to convert our identifiers in `df` to Entrez IDs, but you can, with the change of a single argument, use the same code to convert to many other types of identifiers!

The annotation package `org.Hs.eg.db` contains information for different identifiers [@Carlson2020-human].
`org.Hs.eg.db` is specific to _Homo sapiens_ -- this is what the `Hs` in the package name is referencing.

We can see what types of IDs are available to us in an annotation package with `keytypes()`.

```{r}
keytypes(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

Even though we'll use this package to convert from Ensembl gene IDs (`ENSEMBL`) to Entrez IDs (`ENTREZID`), we could just as easily use it to convert from an Ensembl transcript ID (`ENSEMBLTRANS`) to gene symbols (`SYMBOL`).

Take a look at our other gene identifier conversion examples for examples with different species and gene ID types:
[the microarray example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/gene-id-annotation_microarray_01_ensembl.html) and [the RNA-seq example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/gene-id-annotation_rnaseq_01_ensembl.html).

The function we will use to map from Ensembl gene IDs to Entrez gene IDs is called `mapIds()`.

Let's create a data frame that shows the mapped Entrez IDs along with the gene expression values for the respective Ensembl IDs.

```{r}
# First let's create a mapped data frame we can join to the gene expression values
mapped_df <- data.frame(
  "entrez_id" = mapIds(
    org.Hs.eg.db, # Replace with annotation package for the organism relevant to your data
    keys = df$Gene,
    column = "ENTREZID", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers you would like to map to
    keytype = "ENSEMBL", # Replace with the type of gene identifiers in your data
    multiVals = "first" # This will keep only the first mapped value for each Ensembl ID
  )
) %>%
  # If an Ensembl gene identifier doesn't map to a Entrez gene identifier, drop that
  # from the data frame
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(entrez_id)) %>%
  # Make an `Ensembl` column to store the row names
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Ensembl") %>%
  # Now let's join the rest of the expression data
  dplyr::inner_join(df, by = c("Ensembl" = "Gene"))
```

This `1:many mapping between keys and columns` message means that some Ensembl gene identifiers map to multiple Entrez IDs.
In this case, it's also possible that a Entrez ID will map to multiple Ensembl IDs.
For the purpose of performing GSEA later in this notebook, we keep only the first mapped IDs.
For more about how to explore this, take a look at our [microarray gene ID conversion example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/gene-id-annotation_microarray_01_ensembl.html).

Let's see a preview of `mapped_df`.

```{r}
head(mapped_df)
```

We will want to keep in mind that GSVA requires that data is in a matrix with the gene identifiers as row names.
In order to successfully turn our data frame into a matrix, we will need to ensure that we do not have any duplicate gene identifiers.

Let's check to see if we have any Entrez IDs that mapped to multiple Ensembl IDs.

```{r}
any(duplicated(mapped_df$entrez_id))
```

Looks like we do have duplicated Entrez IDs.
Let's find out which Entrez IDs have been duplicated.

```{r}
dup_entrez_ids <- mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(duplicated(entrez_id)) %>%
  dplyr::pull(entrez_id)

dup_entrez_ids
```

#### Handling duplicate gene identifiers

As we mentioned earlier, we will not want any duplicate gene identifiers in our data frame when we convert it into a matrix in preparation for the GSVA steps later.
GSVA is executed on a per sample basis so let's keep the maximum expression value per sample associated with the duplicate Entrez gene identifiers.
In other words, we will keep only the maximum expression value found across the duplicate Entrez gene identifier instances for each sample or column in this case.

Let's take a look at the rows associated with the duplicated Entrez IDs and see how this will play out. 

```{r}
mapped_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(entrez_id %in% dup_entrez_ids)
```

As an example using the strategy we described, for `GSM187153`'s data in the first column, `-0.007355525` is larger than `-0.136553967` so moving forward, Entrez gene `6013` will have ``-0.007355525` value and the `-0.136553967` would be dropped from the dataset. 
However, this is just one method of handling duplicate gene identifiers.
See the [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) User guide](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html) for more information on other expression values that can be used, like the median expression value for example [@GSEA-user-guide].
Now, let's implement our choose the max value method for all samples and Entrez IDs using tidyverse functions. 

```{r}
max_dup_df <- mapped_df %>%
  # We won't be using Ensembl IDs moving forward, so we will drop this column
  dplyr::select(-"Ensembl") %>%
  # Filter to include only the rows associated with the duplicate Entrez gene identifiers
  dplyr::filter(entrez_id %in% dup_entrez_ids) %>%
  # Group by Entrez IDs
  dplyr::group_by(entrez_id) %>%
  # Get the maximum expression value using all values associated with each duplicate
  # Entrez ID for each column or sample in this case
  dplyr::summarize_all(max)

max_dup_df
```

We can see `GSM187153` now has the `-0.007355525` value for Entrez ID `6013` like expected. 
Looks like we were able to successfully get rid of the duplicate Entrez gene identifiers!

Now let's combine our de-duplicated data with the rest of the mapped data!

```{r}
filtered_mapped_df <- mapped_df %>%
  # We won't be using Ensembl IDs moving forward, so we will drop this column
  dplyr::select(-"Ensembl") %>%
  # First let's get the data associated with the Entrez gene identifiers that aren't duplicated
  dplyr::filter(!entrez_id %in% dup_entrez_ids) %>%
  # Now let's bind the rows of the maximum expression data we stored in `max_dup_df`
  dplyr::bind_rows(max_dup_df)
```

As mentioned earlier, we need a matrix for GSVA.
Let's now convert our data frame into a matrix and prepare our object for GSVA.

```{r}
filtered_mapped_matrix <- filtered_mapped_df %>%
  # We need to store our gene identifiers as row names
  tibble::column_to_rownames("entrez_id") %>%
  # Now we can convert our object into a matrix
  as.matrix()
```

Note that if we had duplicate gene identifiers here, we would not be able to set them as row names.

## GSVA - Microarray

Rather than ranking genes based on some gene-level statistic selected by the user, GSVA fits a model and ranks genes based on their expression level relative to the sample distribution.
The pathway-level score calculated is a way of asking how genes _within_ a gene set vary as compared to genes that are _outside_ of that gene set [@Malhotra2018].

The idea here is that we will get pathway-level scores for each sample that indicate if genes in a pathway vary concordantly in one direction (over-expressed or under-expressed relative to the overall population) [@Hanzelmann2013].

The output is a gene set by sample matrix of GSVA scores.

### Perform GSVA

Let's perform GSVA using the `gsva()` function.

```{r}
gsva_results <- gsva(
  filtered_mapped_matrix,
  hallmarks_list,
  method = "gsva",
  # Appropriate for our log2-transformed microarray data
  kcdf = "Gaussian",
  # Minimum gene set size
  min.sz = 15,
  # Maximum gene set size
  max.sz = 500,
  # Compute Gaussian-distributed scores
  mx.diff = TRUE,
  # Print out information about each calculation step
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

Note that the `gsva()` function documentation says we can use `kcdf = "Gaussian"` if we have expression values that are continuous such as log-CPMs, log-RPKMs or log-TPMs, but we would use `kcdf = "Poisson"` on integer counts.
See `?gsva` for more options.

```{r}
# Let's explore what the output of gsva() looks like
head(gsva_results)
```

### Find the pathway with the most significant differences across treatment groups

First, let's prepare the metadata.

```{r}
# We need to create a column variable to combine and store the information
# we need from `refinebio_disease` and `refinebio_treatment` -- first we need
# to replace the NAs in the treatment column with "none"
metadata <- metadata %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    refinebio_treatment = dplyr::case_when(
      refinebio_treatment == "na" ~ "none",
      TRUE ~ refinebio_treatment
    ),
    disease_status_treatment = paste0(refinebio_disease, "-", refinebio_treatment)
  )
```

Now let's double check that our samples are still in order.

```{r}
all.equal(metadata$refinebio_accession_code, colnames(gsva_results))
```

Now let's prepare the design matrix.

```{r}
# Create the design matrix from the `disease_status_treatmen` variable
des_mat <- model.matrix(~ metadata$disease_status_treatment)
```

Run the linear model on each pathway (each row of `gsva_results`).

```{r}
# Apply linear model to data
fit <- limma::lmFit(gsva_results, design = des_mat)

# Apply empirical Bayes to smooth standard errors
fit <- limma::eBayes(fit)
```

Apply multiple testing correction and obtain a data frame containing the stats. 

```{r}
# Apply multiple testing correction and obtain stats
gsva_stats_df <- limma::topTable(fit, number = nrow(gsva_results)) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("gene set")
```

Now let's arrange the `gsva_stats_df` by the smallest adjusted p values. 

```{r}
gsva_stats_df %>%
  dplyr::arrange(adj.P.Val)
```

`HALLMARK_DNA_REPAIR` appears to be the pathway that contains the most significant distribution of scores across `disease_status_treatment` groups. 

## Visualizing Results

### Violin plot

The goal of the study associated with our dataset is to identify the molecular profiles associated with resistance in patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide (distinguished by the `tmz/radiotherapy` value in the `refinebio_treatment` column) [@Murat2008].
Let's make a violin plot to look at the differences between the disease status and treatment groups using our GSVA scores.

First we need to get this data in an appropriate format for `ggplot2`.

```{r}
annotated_results_df <- gsva_results %>%
  # The results are a matrix
  data.frame() %>%
  # Gene set names are row names
  tibble::rownames_to_column("gene_set") %>%
  # Get into long format using the `tidyr::pivot_longer()` function
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = -gene_set,
    names_to = "sample",
    values_to = "gsva_score"
  ) %>%
  # dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(gsva_score)) %>%
  # Join the column with the group labels that we would like to plot and compare --
  # Select the variables relevant to your data
  dplyr::left_join(dplyr::select(
    metadata,
    refinebio_accession_code,
    disease_status_treatment
  ),
  by = c("sample" = "refinebio_accession_code")
  )
```

Now let's make a violin plot so we can look at the differences between the `disease_status_treatment` groups using our GSVA scores.

```{r}
# Violin plot comparing GSVA scores of the `disease_status_treatment` groups in our dataset
violin_plot <- annotated_results_df %>%
  # Filter for the scores associated with the most signficant pathway found in
  # the previous step -- HALLMARK_DNA_REPAIR
  dplyr::filter(gene_set == "HALLMARK_DNA_REPAIR") %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(
    x = disease_status_treatment, # Replace with a variable relevant to your data
    y = gsva_score
  )) +
  # Make a violin plot that's a pretty blue!
  ggplot2::geom_violin(fill = "#99CCFF", alpha = 0.5) +
  # Add a point with the median value
  ggplot2::stat_summary(
    geom = "point",
    fun = "median",
    # Change the aesthetics of the points
    size = 3,
    color = "#0066CC",
    shape = 18
  ) +
  # Flip the axes
  ggplot2::coord_flip() +
  # Add plot labels
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = "GSVA Scores Across Glioblastoma Treatment Groups",
    x = "Glioblastoma disease status and treatment group",
    y = "GSVA score"
  ) +
  # Adjust the plot background for better visualization
  ggplot2::theme_bw()

# Display plot
violin_plot
```

Now we can interpret our violin plot showing the distribution of GSVA scores across `disease_status_treatment` groups.
Looks like the `non-tumoral` samples which received no treatment are associated with the lowest GSVA scores, while the `recurrent gbm` and `gbm` samples which received the concomitant chemoradiotherapy (`tmz/radiotherapy`) treatment are associated with the higher GSVA scores.

Let's save this plot to PNG.

```{r}
ggplot2::ggsave(file.path(plots_dir, "GSE7696_gsva_violin_plot.png"),
  plot = violin_plot
)
```

## Write results to file

Now let's write our GSVA results to file.

```{r}
gsva_results %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("pathway") %>%
  readr::write_tsv(file.path(
    results_dir,
    "GSE7696_gsva_results.tsv"
  ))
```
