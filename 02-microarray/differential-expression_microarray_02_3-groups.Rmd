# Purpose of this analysis

This notebook takes data and metadata from refine.bio and identifies differentially expressed genes with more than 2 groups. 

⬇️ [**Jump to the analysis code**](#analysis) ⬇️

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/differential-expression_microarray_02_3-groups.Rmd).

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)
Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

For general information about downloading data for these examples, see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-the-data).

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready. 

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [medulloblastoma samples](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE37418/novel-mutations-target-distinct-subgroups-of-medulloblastoma).
@Robinson2012 measured microarray gene expression of 71 medulloblastoma tumor samples. 
In this analysis, we will test differential expression across the medulloblastoma subtypes. 

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `<experiment_accession_id>` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `GSE37418` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis Rmd you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `GSE37418` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  
    
Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession id and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
Run this chunk to double check that your files are in the right place. 

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "GSE37418")

# Check if the gene expression matrix file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "GSE37418.tsv"))

# Check if the metadata file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "metadata_GSE37418.tsv"))
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

# Differential Expression - Microarray

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

In this analysis, we will be using `limma` for differential expression [@Ritchie2015].
We will also use `EnhancedVolcano` for plotting and `apeglm` for some log fold change estimates in the results table [@Blighe2020, @Zhu2018].

```{r}
if (!("limma" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("limma", update = FALSE)
}
if (!("EnhancedVolcano" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("EnhancedVolcano", update = FALSE)
}
if (!("apeglm" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install("apeglm", update = FALSE)
}
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis.

```{r}
# Attach the library
library(limma)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)

# We'll use this for plotting
library(ggplot2)
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file. 
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your metadata file
  "metadata_GSE37418.tsv" # Replace with the name of your metadata file
))

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your data file
  "GSE37418.tsv" # Replace with the name of your data file
)) %>%
  # Tuck away the Gene id column as rownames
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

## Set up design matrix

`limma` needs a numeric design matrix to signify which samples are of which subtype of medulloblastoma. 
Here we are using the treatments supplied in the metadata to create a design matrix where the "none" samples are assigned `0` and the "amputated" samples are assigned `1`.
Note that the metadata variables that signify the treatment groups might be different across datasets and might not always be underneath the category.

```{r Set up design matrix}
# Set up group names in the `subgroup` column
metadata <- metadata %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(subgroup = gsub("Group 3|Group 4", "NonSHH", subgroup))
```

Let's take a look at how many sample of each subgroup we have. 

```{r}
summary(metadata$subgroup)
```

Looks like there is one sample that has been labeled by the authors as an outlier, as well as one group, `U`, that only has two samples. 
We will probably want to remove the `U` samples and this outlier since their inclusion might throw off our differential expression analysis results. 

## Removing groups that are too small

Let's start out by removing the outlier and the `U` group, we can do this all at once by removing groups smaller than 3. 

```{r}
filtered_metadata <- metadata %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(subgroup) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(dplyr::n() > 3) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup()
```

Let's take a look at the subgroup summary again. 

```{r}
summary(filtered_metadata$subgroup)
```

Note that the `levels()` we just filtered out are still here. 
We'll need to reset the factor. 

```{r}
filtered_metadata <- filtered_metadata %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(subgroup = factor(subgroup))
```

Check this again. 

```{r}
summary(filtered_metadata$subgroup)
```

Now only the four groups we are look for are here. 

But, we still need to filter these out from the expression data that's stored in `df`. 

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(filtered_metadata$geo_accession)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), filtered_metadata$geo_accession)
```

## Create the design matrix

Now we will create a model matrix based on our `subgroup` variable.
We are using a `+ 0` in the model so no particular group is treated as the baselinee/control. 

```{r}
# Create the design matrix
des_mat <- model.matrix(~ filtered_metadata$subgroup + 0)
```

Let's take a look at what our design matrix looks like. 

```{r}
# Print out the design matrix
head(des_mat)
```

The design matrix column names are a bit messy, so we will rename them based on the levels

```{r}
# Make the column name more informative
colnames(des_mat) <- levels(filtered_metadata$subgroup)
```

## Perform differential expression

First we need to set up our basic linear model then apply empirical Bayes smoothing.  

```{r}
# Apply linear model to data
fit <- lmFit(df, design = des_mat)

# Apply empirical Bayes to smooth standard errors
fit <- eBayes(fit)
```

Now that we have our basic model fitting, we need to make the contrasts between all our groups. 
Depending on your scientific questions, you will need to switch this around.
Consulting the [limma users guide](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf) for how to alter these steps is good idea. 

In this contrasts matrix, we are comparing each subtype to all the other subtypes.  

```{r}
contrast_matrix <- makeContrasts("G3vsOther"= G3 - (G4 + SHH + WNT)/3, 
                                 "G4vsOther"= G4 - (G3 + SHH + WNT)/3,
                                 "SHHvsOther"= SHH - (G3 + G4 + WNT)/3,
                                 "WNTvsOther"= WNT - (G3 + G4 + SHH)/3,
                                 levels = des_mat)
```

Now that we have the contrasts matrix set up, we can use it to re-fit the model and re-smooth it with `eBayes()`. 
```{r}
# Fit the model according to the contrasts matrix
contrasts_fit <- contrasts.fit(fit, contrast_matrix)

# Re-smooth the Bayes
contrasts_fit <- eBayes(contrasts_fit)
```

Now let's create the results table based on the contrasts fitted model. 

This step will provide the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. 
The `topTable()` function default is to use Benjamini-Hochberg but this can be changed to a different method using the `adjust.method` argument (see the `?topTable` help page for more about the options).

```{r}
# Apply multiple testing correction and obtain stats
stats_df <- topTable(contrasts_fit, number = nrow(df)) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Gene")
```

Let's take a peek at what our results table looks like. 

```{r}
head(stats_df)
```
Each group's fold change in comparison to the other groups average are reported. 

By default, results are ordered by largest `F` value to the smallest, which means your most differentially expressed genes should be toward the top. 

See the help page by using `?topTable` for more information and options for this table.

## Check results by plotting one gene

To test if these results make sense, we can make a plot of one of top genes. 
Let's try extracting the data for `ENSG00000128683` and set up its own data frame for plotting purposes. 
Based on the results in `stats_df`, we should expect this gene to be much higher in the `WNT` samples. 

First we will need to set up the data for this gene and the subgroup labels into a data frame for plotting. 

```{r}
top_gene_df <- df %>%
  # Extract this gene from `df`
  dplyr::filter(rownames(.) == "ENSG00000128683") %>%
  # Transpose so the gene is a column
  t() %>%
  # Transpose made this a matrix, let's make it back into a data.frame like before
  data.frame() %>%
  # Store the sample ids as their own column instead of being row names
  tibble::rownames_to_column("refinebio_accession_code") %>%
  # Join on the selected columns from metadata
  dplyr::inner_join(dplyr::select(
    metadata,
    refinebio_accession_code,
    subgroup
  ))
```

Let's take a sneak peek at what our `top_gene_df` looks like. 

```{r}
top_gene_df
```

Now let's plot the data for `ENSG00000128683` using our `top_gene_df`.
We should expect this gene to be expressed at much higher levels in the `WNT` group samples. 

```{r}
ggplot(top_gene_df, aes(x = subgroup, y = ENSG00000128683, color = subgroup)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + # We'll make this a jitter plot
  theme_classic() # This makes some aesthetic changes
```

Yes! These results make sense.
The WNT samples have much higher expression of ENSG00000128683 than the other samples. 

## Write results to file

The results in `stats_df` will be saved to our `results/` directory. 

```{r}
readr::write_tsv(stats_df, file.path(
  results_dir,
  "GSE37418_limma_results.tsv" # Replace with a relevant output name
))
```

## Make a volcano plot

We'll use the `EnhancedVolcano` package's main function to plot our data [@Zhu2018].

We will have to choose one of the groups fold changes to plot. 
Let's plot the `SHH` fold changes for this example (You can add more chunks and plot the other subgroup results if you wish!)

```{r}
EnhancedVolcano::EnhancedVolcano(stats_df,
  lab = stats_df$Gene, # This has to be a vector with our labels we want for our genes
  x = "SHHvsOther", # This is the column name in `stats_df` that contains what we want on the x axis
  y = "adj.P.Val", # This is the column name in `stats_df` that contains what we want on the y axis
  title = "SHH vs other groups" # We will put this on the title so we know which fold change we are plotting. 
)
```

In this plot, green points represent genes that meet the log2 fold change, by default the cutoff is absolute value of 1.  
But there are no genes that meet the p value cutoff, which by default is `1e-05`. 
We used the adjusted p values for our plot above, so you may want to adjust this with the `pCutoff` argument (Take a look at all the options for tailoring this plot using `?EnhancedVolcano`).

Let's make the same plot again, still using `SHHvsOther` but adjust the `pCutoff` since we are using multiple-testing corrected p values, and this time we will assign the plot to our environment as `volcano_plot`. 

```{r}
volcano_plot <- EnhancedVolcano::EnhancedVolcano(stats_df,
  lab = stats_df$Gene,
  x = "SHHvsOther",
  y = "adj.P.Val",
  pCutoff = 0.01, # Because we are using adjusted p values, we can loosen this a bit
  title = "SHH results"
)

# Print out our plot
volcano_plot
```

Let's save this plot to a PNG file. 
We'll put `SHH` in the name so we are aware which results this is showing. 

```{r}
ggsave(
  plot = volcano_plot,
  file.path(plots_dir, "GSE37418_SHH_results_volcano_plot.png")
) # Replace with a plot name relevant to your data
```
