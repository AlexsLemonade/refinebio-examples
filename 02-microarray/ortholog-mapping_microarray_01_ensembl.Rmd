# Purpose of this analysis

This notebook demonstrates how you can use the [`hcop`](https://github.com/stephenturner/hcop) package to perform ortholog mapping for microarray data obtained from refine.bio.
In this notebook, we will use zebrafish data from refine.bio and annotate it with human gene symbols from HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP).

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/ortholog-mapping_microarray_01_ensembl.Rmd).

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)
Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" # Can replace with path to desired output plots directory

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" # Can replace with path to desired output results directory

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready. 

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [zebrafish kidney side population (SP) cell dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE12955/gene-expression-profile-of-zebrafish-kidney-side-population-sp-cells).

This dataset has 4 microarray zebrafish kidney side population (SP) cell samples.

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `<experiment_accession_id>` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `GSE12955` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `GSE12955` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  
    
Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession id and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/e140face75daa6d2c34e30a4755c362e6039a677/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
Run this chunk to double check that your files are in the right place. 

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
data_dir <- file.path("data", "GSE12955")

# Check if the gene expression matrix file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "GSE12955.tsv"))

# Check if the metadata file is in the data directory stored as `data_dir`
file.exists(file.path(data_dir, "metadata_GSE12955.tsv"))
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

# Ortholog Mapping with `hcop` - Microarray

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

In this analysis, we will be using `hcop` to map between zebrafish and human identifiers [@Turner2018].

We'll need to use the [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package to install `hcop` from Github.

```{r}
if (!("devtools" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
```

Now we can install `hcop` from Github.
You can control what version of the package is installed by using the `ref` command of `devtools::install_github`.
Here, we'll use the most recent commit at the time that we are putting together this example.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("stephenturner/hcop", ref = "0985fddc91a6ef2308f4800958dfd11c25fe6a98")
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis.

```{r}
# Attach the library
library(hcop)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file. 
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your metadata file
  "metadata_GSE12955.tsv" # Replace with the name of your metadata file
))

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(file.path(
  data_dir, # Replace with path to your data file
  "GSE12955.tsv" # Replace with the name of your data file
)) %>%
  # Tuck away the Gene id column as rownames
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order. 

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(metadata$geo_accession)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), metadata$geo_accession)

# Bring back the "Gene" column in preparation for mapping
df <- df %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Gene")
```

## Mapping zebrafish Ensembl gene IDs to human symbols

refine.bio data uses Ensembl gene identifiers, which will be in the first column.

```{r}
# Let's take a look at the first 6 items in the first column of `df`
head(df[, 1])
```

In zebrafish, Ensembl gene identifiers begin with `ENSDARG`.

Now let's do the conversion!
We'll use the `zebrafish` data from `hcop`; this is what `zebrafish` looks like.

```{r}
zebrafish
```

We're interested in the `human_symbol` and `zebrafish_ensembl` columns specifically.

```{r}
human_symbol_df <- zebrafish %>%
  # we'll want to subset zebrafish to only the columns we're interested in
  dplyr::select(zebrafish_ensembl, human_symbol) %>%
  # only retain the genes from the expression matrix that are in zebrafish data
  dplyr::inner_join(df, by = c("zebrafish_ensembl" = "Gene"))
```

Here's what the new data frame looks like:

```{r}
head(human_symbol_df, 25)
```

Let's get a summary of the gene symbols returned in the `human_symbol` column of our mapped data frame.

```{r}
# We can use the `summary()` function to get a better idea of the distribution of symbols in the `Symbol` column
summary(as.factor(human_symbol_df$human_symbol)) # We need to use the `as.factor()` function here in order to get the count of each unique value returned
```

Looks like we have mapped symbols!
It does not explicitly tell us if we have IDs that did not map to symbols, which would result in NAs so let's explore to find out if we do have any.

```{r}
any(is.na(human_symbol_df$human_symbol)) # Logical statement to check if there are any NAs in the `human_symbol` column of our mapped data frame
```

There are no NAs!
This means that all of our zebrafish Ensembl IDs mapped to at least one human gene symbol!
This is exciting because it is not always the case everything maps across species and that is okay.

However, if you have almost all NAs it is possible that the function was executed incorrectly or you may want to consider using a different gene identifier, if possible.

## Write results to file

Now let's write our results to file.

```{r}
readr::write_tsv(
  human_symbol_df,
  file.path(
    results_dir,
    "GSE12955_ensembl_to_human_gene_symbol.tsv" # Replace with a relevant output file name
  )
)
```

*Some things to note:*

* Multiple zebrafish Ensembl gene IDs map to the same human symbol which results in duplicated human gene symbols.
Some downstream tools may need this to be resolved.
* If a zebrafish Ensembl gene ID maps to multiple human symbols, the gene expression values get duplicated.
Let's look at the `ENSDARG00000069142` example below.

```{r}
human_symbol_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(zebrafish_ensembl == "ENSDARG00000069142")
```

We can collapse the multi-mapped values into a list for each Ensembl ID or we can keep it in the format above with one row for each mapped ID (resulting in duplicated rows for some Ensembl IDs).

## Collapse mapped values

In the next chunk, we show how we can collapse all the symbols into one column where we store them all for each unique Ensembl ID.

```{r}
collapsed_symbol_df <- human_symbol_df %>%
  # Group by Ensembl IDs
  dplyr::group_by(zebrafish_ensembl) %>%
  # Collapse the mapped values in `human_symbol_df` into one column named `all_human_symbols`
  dplyr::summarize(all_human_symbols = paste(human_symbol, collapse = ";"))

head(collapsed_symbol_df)
```

## Write collapsed results to file

```{r}
readr::write_tsv(
  collapsed_symbol_df,
  file.path(
    results_dir,
    "GSE12955_collapsed_ensembl_to_human_gene_symbol.tsv" # Replace with a relevant output file name
  )
)
```

# Session info

At the end of every analysis, before saving your notebook, we recommend printing out your session info. 
This helps make your code more reproducible by recording what versions of software and packages you used to run this. 

```{r}
# Print session info
sessionInfo()
```
