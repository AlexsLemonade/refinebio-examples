Briefly, tissue samples were homogenized in the STAT-60 using teflon homogenizers. Chloroform was added and the samples centrifuged. The upper layer (aqueous phase) was removed to a fresh tube and the RNA precipitated with isopropanol. Following centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed once in 75% ethanol, then the air-dried pellet resuspended in DEPC-treated water.	GSM918650	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Human U133 v2.0. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.
