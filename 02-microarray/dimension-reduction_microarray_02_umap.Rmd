# Purpose of this analysis

This notebook illustrates one way that you can use microarray data from refine.bio to perform Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) and plot the coordinates using `ggplot2`.

⬇️ [**Jump to the analysis code**](#analysis) ⬇️

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/02-microarray/dimension-reduction_microarray_02_umap.Rmd).

Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots"

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results"

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready.

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [medulloblastoma dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE37382).

The data that we downloaded from refine.bio for this analysis has 285 microarray samples obtained from patients with medulloblastoma.
The purpose of the experiment is to identify the predominant regions with somatic copy number aberrations in each medulloblastoma subgroup.
We will use the `subgroup` and `histology` variables from our metadata to annotate our plot later.
These variables hold the information on the one of the defined subgroups of medulloblastoma to which it sample belongs to and the molecular histology of each sample, respectively.

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `<experiment_accession_id>` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the `GSE37382` folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `GSE37382` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  
    
Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession ID and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
These chunks will declare your file paths and double check that your files are in the right place.

First we will declare our file paths to our data and metadata files, which should be in our data directory.
This is handy to do because if we want to switch the dataset (see next section for more on this) we are using for this analysis, we will only have to change the file path here to get started. 

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
# Replace with the path of the folder the files will be in
data_dir <- file.path("data", "GSE37382")

# Declare the file path to the gene expression matrix file
# inside directory saved as `data_dir`
# Replace with the path to your dataset file
data_file <- file.path(data_dir, "GSE37382.tsv")

# Declare the file path to the metadata file
# inside the directory saved as `data_dir`
# Replace with the path to your metadata file
metadata_file <- file.path(data_dir, "metadata_GSE37382.tsv")
```

Now that our file paths are declared, we can use the `file.exists()` function to check that the files are where we specified above. 

```{r}
# Check if the gene expression matrix file is at the path stored in `data_file`
file.exists(data_file)

# Check if the metadata file is at the file path stored in `metadata_file`
file.exists(metadata_file)
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

Note that UMAP does require more dimensions than PCA, though, so if you have a smaller dataset (less than 20) and you obtain errors, you may not be able to run UMAP for your dataset.

# UMAP Visualization - Microarray

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

In this analysis, we will be using the R package `umap` [@Konopka2020] for the production of UMAP dimension reduction values and the R package `ggplot2` [@Prabhakaran2016] for plotting the UMAP values.

```{r}
if (!("umap" %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install umap package
  BiocManager::install("umap", update = FALSE)
}
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis:

```{r message=FALSE}
# Attach the `umap` library
library(umap)

# Attach the `ggplot2` library
library(ggplot2)

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)
```

The UMAP algorithm utilizes random sampling so we are going to set the seed to make our results reproducible.

```{r}
# Set the seed so our results are reproducible:
set.seed(12345)
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file. 
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

We stored our file paths as objects named `metadata_file` and `data_file` in [this previous step](#check-out-our-file-structure).

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(metadata_file)

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(data_file) %>%
  # Tuck away the gene ID  column as rownames
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order. 

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(metadata$geo_accession)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), metadata$geo_accession)
```

## Perform Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP)

Now we are going to use a combination of functions from the `umap` and the `ggplot2` packages to perform and visualize the results of the Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) dimension reduction technique on our medulloblastoma samples.

In this code chunk, we are going to perform Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) on our data and create a data frame using the UMAP scores and the variables from our metadata that we are going to use to annotate our plot later.

```{r}
# Perform Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) using the `umap::umap()` function
umap_data <- umap::umap(
  t(df) # We have to transpose our data frame so we are obtaining UMAP scores for samples instead of genes
)

# Make into data frame for plotting with `ggplot2`
umap_df <- data.frame(umap_data$layout) %>% # The umap values we need for plotting are stored in this `layout` element
  # Turn samples_ids stored as rownames into column
  tibble::rownames_to_column("refinebio_accession_code") %>%
  # Bring only the variables that we want from the metadata into this data frame; match by sample ids
  dplyr::inner_join(dplyr::select(metadata, refinebio_accession_code, histology, subgroup),
    by = "refinebio_accession_code"
  )
```

Let's take a preview at the data frame we created in the chunk above.

```{r}
head(umap_df)
```

Now, let's plot the UMAP scores.

```{r}
# Make a scatterplot using `ggplot2` functionality
umap_plot <- ggplot(
  umap_df,
  aes(
    x = X1,
    y = X2
  )
) +
  geom_point() + # This tells R that we want a scatterplot
  theme_classic() # This tells R to return a classic-looking plot with no gridlines

# Print out plot here
umap_plot
```

It's hard to interpret our UMAP results without some metadata labels on our plot.

Let's label the data points based on their genotype subgroup since this is central to the subgroup specific based hypothesis in the original paper [@Northcott2012].

```{r}
# Make a scatterplot with ggplot2
umap_plot <- ggplot(
  umap_df,
  aes(
    x = X1,
    y = X2,
    color = subgroup # This will label points with different colors for each `subgroup`
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()

# Print out plot here
umap_plot
```

It looks like Group 4 and SHH groups somewhat cluster with each other but Group 3 seems to also be clustering with Group 4.

We can add another label to our plot to potentially gain insight on the clustering behavior of our data.
Let's also label the data points based on the histological subtype that each sample belongs to.

```{r}
# Make a scatterplot with ggplot2
umap_plot <- ggplot(
  umap_df,
  aes(
    x = X1,
    y = X2,
    color = subgroup, # This will label points with different colors for each `subgroup`
    shape = histology # This will label points with different colors for each `histology` group
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()

# Print out plot here
umap_plot
```

Our histological subtype groups don't appear to be clustering in a discernible pattern. 
We could test out other variables as annotation labels to get a further understanding of the cluster behavior of each subgroup.

## Save annotated UMAP plot as a PNG

You can easily switch this to save to a JPEG or TIFF by changing the file name within the `ggsave()` function to the respective file suffix.

```{r}
# Save plot using `ggsave()` function
ggsave(file.path(
  plots_dir,
  "GSE37382_umap_scatterplot.png" # Replace with name relevant your plotted data
),
plot = umap_plot # Here we are giving the function the plot object that we want saved to file
)
```
