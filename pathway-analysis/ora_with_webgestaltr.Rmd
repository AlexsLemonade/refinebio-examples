## Background

Over-representation analysis (ORA) is a method of pathway or gene set analysis
where one can ask if a set of genes (e.g., those differentially expressed
using some cutoff) shares more or less genes with gene sets/pathways than
we would expect at random.
The other methodologies introduced throughout this module such as QuSAGE and
GSEA can require more samples than a different expression analysis. 
For instance, the sample label permutation step of GSEA is reported to
perform poorly with 7 samples or less in each group 
([Yaari et al. _NAR_. 2013.](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt660)).
It is not uncommon to have n ~ 3 for each group in a treatment-control 
transcriptomic study, at which point identifying differentially expressed genes
is possible.
If you are interested in performing pathway analysis on a small study, ORA may
be your best bet.
There are some limitations to ORA methods to be aware such as ignoring 
gene-gene correlation.
See [Khatri et al. _PLoS Comp Bio._ 2012.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002375) 
to learn more about the different types of pathway analysis and their 
limitations.

## Data

In this example, we will use a table of differential expression analysis results
from another one of the example modules 
([`validate-differential-expression`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/tree/master/validate-differential-expression)).
Genes were tested for differential expression between the SHH and Groups 3 and
4 subgroups of medulloblastoma in refine.bio-processed data from
[Robinson et al. _Nature_. 2012.](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11213)
([`GSE37418`](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE37418/novel-mutations-target-distinct-subgroups-of-medulloblastoma)).
We will read in these results from GitHub.

## Set up

#### Package installation and loading

```{r}
if (!("WebGestaltR" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("WebGestaltR")
}
```

```{r}
`%>%` <- dplyr::`%>%`
```

```{r}
library(WebGestaltR)
```

#### Directories

```{r}
if (!dir.exists("results")) {
  dir.create("results")
}
```

## Over-Representation Analysis with `WebGestaltR`

### Differentially expressed genes from Robinson et al.

We will read in the differential expression results from GitHub.
These results are from a two group comparison using 
[`limma`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html).
The table contains Ensembl gene IDs, log fold-change, and adjusted p-values
(FDR in this case).
We can identify upregulated genes by filtering these results and use this list
as input to ORA.

```{r}
dge_df <- readr::read_tsv("https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/10b116dff0d44267db3e3a6fde735187e1bcd195/validate-differential-expression/results/GSE37418_limma_results.tsv")
```

Here we'll use log fold-change > 2 and FDR < 0.05 as cutoffs for determining 
what genes are of interest.

```{r}
upregulated_genes <- dge_df %>%
  dplyr::filter(logFC > 2, adj.P.Val < 0.05) %>%
  dplyr::pull(ENSEMBL)
```

Because we are testing if there is more overlap between a set of genes of 
interest and gene sets or pathways from some knowledgebase (e.g., KEGG, Gene 
Ontology (GO)) than we would expect at random, we need to identify an 
appropriate background set. 
Put another way, if a gene is _not measured_, it can not possibly be in
our gene set of interest.
We can provide our analysis method of choice with a reference list, which
we will generate by selecting all the genes in the table of differential
expression results.

```{r}
all_genes <- dge_df %>% 
   dplyr::pull(ENSEMBL)
```

### WebGestaltR

We can check whether or not we need to convert to a different gene identifier by
figuring out what gene identifiers `WebGestaltR` accepts for human.
We can do this with the `listIdType` function; the first argument is the 
organism name.

```{r}
listIdType("hsapiens")
```

We can see that `"ensembl_gene_id"` is a compatible identifier, and therefore
we do not need to convert to a different identifier.

The `WebGestaltR` function is a wrapper for the [WEB-based GEne SeT
AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt)](http://www.webgestalt.org/) 
([Wang et al. _NAR_. 2017.](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx356); 
note that WebGestalt has a new 2019 version).

WebGestalt can perform multiple _types_ of pathway analysis. 
Here we're using it for ORA and we will use [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-documentation/) biological
processes as our source of gene sets.
We can see all supported gene sets for humans with `listGeneSet`.

```{r}
listGeneSet("hsapiens")
```

`WebGestaltR` will generate an HTML file with a report (path specified
by the `outputDirectory` and `projectName` arguments) _and_ return a 
`data.frame`.

```{r}
go_enrichment_results <- 
  WebGestaltR(enrichMethod = "ORA",
              organism = "hsapiens",
              enrichDatabase = "geneontology_Biological_Process",
              interestGene = upregulated_genes,
              interestGeneType = "ensembl_gene_id",
              referenceGene = all_genes,
              referenceGeneType = "ensembl_gene_id",
              outputDirectory = "results",
              projectName = "GSE37418_up_SHH_lfc2_fdr0.05")
```

As noted in the messages from `WebGestaltR`, the results are in
`results/Project_GSE37418_up_SHH_lfc2_fdr0.05`.
The HTML report is at 
[`results/Project_GSE37418_up_SHH_lfc2_fdr0.05/Report_GSE37418_up_SHH_lfc2_fdr0.05.html`](./results/Project_GSE37418_up_SHH_lfc2_fdr0.05/Report_GSE37418_up_SHH_lfc2_fdr0.05.html).

It looks like there are a lot of pathways associated with ribosomes and
translation.
Gene sets, particularly GO gene sets that are of a hierarchical nature, are
not independent, so it's important to keep in mind that many of these gene sets 
could be telling us the same thing.
