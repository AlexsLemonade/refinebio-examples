- Getting Started
    - About refine.bio (link out to docs!) 
    - About how this tutorial book is structured (i.e. each analysis has its own somewhat repetitive info about getting started)
    - What you need to install to run the examples
         - Can borrow from: https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples#general-requirements-for-the-example-workflows
   - How to get the data - this is still to be determined 
      - Might be able to borrow from, but will likely be very different: https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples#how-to-use-this-repository.
    - How to use/get Rmds 
       - Should definitely link to: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/
- A quick primer on file paths and R
    - Borrow from: https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/intro-to-R-tidyverse where appropriate. 
- Resources for learning R
