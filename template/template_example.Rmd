# Purpose of this analysis


⬇️ [**Jump to the analysis code**](#analysis) ⬇️

# How to run this example

For general information about our tutorials and the basic software packages you will need, please see our ['Getting Started' section](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-this-tutorial-is-structured).
We recommend taking a look at our [Resources for Learning R](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#resources-for-learning-r) if you have not written code in R before. 

## Obtain the `.Rmd` file

To run this example yourself, [download the `.Rmd` for this analysis by clicking this link](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/ {{RELATIVE PATH TO THIS ANALYSIS FROM REFINEBIO-EXAMPLES}}).

Clicking this link will most likely send this to your downloads folder on your computer. 
Move this `.Rmd` file to where you would like this example and its files to be stored.

You can open this `.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the rest of these steps from there. (See our [section about getting started with R notebooks](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) if you are unfamiliar with `.Rmd` files.)

## Set up your analysis folders 

Good file organization is helpful for keeping your data analysis project on track!
We have set up some code that will automatically set up a folder structure for you. 
Run this next chunk to set up your folders! 

If you have trouble running this chunk, see our [introduction to using `.Rmd`s](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#how-to-get-and-use-rmds) for more resources and explanations. 

```{r}
# Create the data folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Define the file path to the plots directory
plots_dir <- "plots" 

# Create the plots folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(plots_dir)) {
  dir.create(plots_dir)
}

# Define the file path to the results directory
results_dir <- "results" 

# Create the results folder if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(results_dir)) {
  dir.create(results_dir)
}
```

In the same place you put this `.Rmd` file, you should now have three new empty folders called `data`, `plots`, and `results`!

## Obtain the dataset from refine.bio

We are going to use non-quantile normalized data for this analysis.
To get this data, you will need to check the box that says "Skip quantile normalization for RNA-seq samples".
Note that this option will only be available for RNA-seq datasets.

It may take a few minutes for the dataset to process.
You will get an email when it is ready. 

## About the dataset we are using for this example

For this example analysis, we will use this [{{BRIEF DATASET NAME}}]({{REFINEBIO DATASET PAGE LINK}})..

<!--BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THIS DATASET--> 

## Place the dataset in your new `data/` folder

refine.bio will send you a download button in the email when it is ready. 
Follow the prompt to download a zip file that has a name with a series of letters and numbers and ends in `.zip`. 
Double clicking should unzip this for you and create a folder of the same name.  

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/download-folder-structure.png" width=400> 

For more details on the contents of this folder see [these docs on refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#downloadable-files).  

The `<experiment_accession_id>` folder has the data and metadata TSV files you will need for this example analysis.
Experiment accession ids usually look something like `GSE1235` or `SRP12345`. 

Copy and paste the {{EXPERIMENT_ACCESSION_ID}} folder into your newly created `data/` folder.

## Check out our file structure!

Your new analysis folder should contain: 

- The example analysis `.Rmd` you downloaded  
- A folder called "data" which contains:
  - The `{{EXPERIMENT_ACCESSION_ID}}` folder which contains:
    - The gene expression  
    - The metadata TSV  
- A folder for `plots` (currently empty)  
- A folder for `results` (currently empty)  
    
Your example analysis folder should now look something like this (except with respective experiment accession ID and analysis notebook name you are using): 

<img src="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/raw/40e47f4d3f39283effbd9843a457168061be9680/template/screenshots/analysis-folder-structure.png" width=400>

In order for our example here to run without a hitch, we need these files to be in these locations so we've constructed a test to check before we get started with the analysis. 
These chunks will declare your file paths and double check that your files are in the right place. 

First we will declare our file paths to our data and metadata files, which should be in our data directory.
This is handy to do because if we want to switch the dataset (see next section for more on this) we are using for this analysis, we will only have to change the file path here to get started. 

```{r}
# Define the file path to the data directory
# Replace with the path of the folder the files will be in
data_dir <- file.path("data", {{experiment_accession}}) 

# Declare the file path to the gene expression matrix file
# inside directory saved as `data_dir`
# Replace with the path to your dataset file
data_file <- file.path(data_dir, {{DATA_ACCESSION FILENAME}}) 

# Declare the file path to the metadata file
# inside the directory saved as `data_dir`
# Replace with the path to your metadata file
metadata_file <- file.path(data_dir, {{METADATA_ACCESSION FILENAME}}) 
```

Now that our file paths are declared, we can use the `file.exists()` function to check that the files are where we specified above. 

```{r}
# Check if the gene expression matrix file is at the path stored in `data_file`
file.exists(data_file)

# Check if the metadata file is at the file path stored in `metadata_file`
file.exists(metadata_file)
```

If the chunk above printed out `FALSE` to either of those tests, you won't be able to run this analysis _as is_ until those files are in the appropriate place.

If the concept of a "file path" is unfamiliar to you; we recommend taking a look at our [section about file paths](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#an-important-note-about-file-paths-and-Rmds). 

# Using a different refine.bio dataset with this analysis?

If you'd like to adapt an example analysis to use a different dataset from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/), we recommend placing the files in the `data/` directory you created and changing the filenames and paths in the notebook to match these files (we've put comments to signify where you would need to change the code).
We suggest saving plots and results to `plots/` and `results/` directories, respectively, as these are automatically created by the notebook.
From here you can customize this analysis example to fit your own scientific questions and preferences.

## Install libraries

See our Getting Started page with [instructions for package installation](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html#what-you-need-to-install) for a list of the other software you will need, as well as more tips and resources.

In this analysis, we will be using {{PACKAGE}} [{{CITATION}}].

```{r}
if (!({{PACKAGE}} %in% installed.packages())) {
  # Install this package if it isn't installed yet
  BiocManager::install({{PACKAGE}}, update = FALSE)
}
```

Attach the packages we need for this analysis.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Attach the library
library({{PACKAGE}})

# We will need this so we can use the pipe: %>%
library(magrittr)

{{SET THE SEED IF YOU NEED}}
```

## Import and set up data

Data downloaded from refine.bio include a metadata tab separated values (TSV) file and a data TSV file. 
This chunk of code will read the both TSV files and add them as data frames to your environment.

We stored our file paths as objects named `metadata_file` and `data_file` in [this previous step](#check-out-our-file-structure).

```{r}
# Read in metadata TSV file
metadata <- readr::read_tsv(metadata_file)

# Read in data TSV file
df <- readr::read_tsv(data_file) %>%
  # Tuck away the gene ID  column as row names
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Let's ensure that the metadata and data are in the same sample order. 

```{r}
# Make the data in the order of the metadata
df <- df %>% 
  dplyr::select(metadata$geo_accession)

# Check if this is in the same order
all.equal(colnames(df), metadata$geo_accession)
```

# Session info

At the end of every analysis, before saving your notebook, we recommend printing out your session info. 
This helps make your code more reproducible by recording what versions of software and packages you used to run this. 

```{r}
# Print session info 
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
