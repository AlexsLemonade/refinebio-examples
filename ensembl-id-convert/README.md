# <u>Refinebio Examples: Ensemble ID conversion </u>
This directory contains example workflows of how to annotate data with Ensembl
IDs downloaded from <a href="refine.bio.org"> refine.bio </a>

### Annotation using Ensembl IDs in R
This <a href="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples/blob/master/ensembl_id_convert.html">
notebook </a> illustrates how to obtain annotation for data based on their Ensembl
IDs using `AnnotationDb` packages from Bioconductor.
The script also explains how it can be changed for use with different species
and/or different types of annotation.
