They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.

Cells were exposed to .1mM, .5mM, 1.0mM, 1.5mM, 2.0mM, 2.5mM, 3.0mM, 3.5 and 4.0mM CEES.  Post agent exposure cells were incubated in a chemical fume hood for one hour at 37C without CO2, and placed in tissue culture incubator at 37C with 5% CO2 for the remainder of the exposure period.  Exposure periods were 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, 16hr, and 24hr.  Time matched controls were carried out with each exposure group.	RNA	NA	NA	NA

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.

From these stock solutions, 4 mM solutions in KGM Media (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) were made and immediately placed on ice prior to exposure.  A frozen aliquot of neat bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide (sulfur mustard;SM) in KGM was thawed and vortexed for 30 sec to generate a 4 mM stock SM solution. This solution was placed on ice immediately after generation prior to exposure.  Cells were exposed to 12.5M, 25M, 50uM, 100uM, 200uM, 400uM, 600uM, 800uM, and 1000uM NM or SM.  Cells were exposed to .1mM, .5mM, 1.0mM, 1.5mM, 2.0mM, 2.5mM, 3.0mM, 3.5 and 4.0mM CEES.  Post agent exposure cells were incubated in a chemical fume hood for one hour at 37C without CO2, and placed in tissue culture incubator at 37C with 5% CO2 for the remainder of the exposure period.  Exposure periods were 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, 16hr, and 24hr.  Time matched controls were carried out with each exposure group.	RNA	NA	NA	NA

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells. Detailed analysis procedure can be found in the Supplement to Hafner et al.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.
