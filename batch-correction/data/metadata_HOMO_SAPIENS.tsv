They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t469ns_3:42ug.		mutant hek_t469		GSM546585					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	23-12-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t469fsh_1:24ug.		mutant hek_t469		GSM546587					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	23-12-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t469ns_2:72ug.		mutant hek_t469		GSM546593					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	23-12-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t469fsh_3:23.6ug.		mutant hek_t469		GSM546582					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	23-12-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.

First, the CEL files were imported into R 2.8.0 using the justRMA function of the Affymetrix library from Bioconductor, which applies background subtraction and quantile normalization. An alternate CDF file (U133Plus2msk.cdf.gz) was used to exclude mis-targeted and nonspecific probes from the microarrays (Zhang et al. 2005), and probesets with less than 7 remaining probes were also excluded. Probesets with more than 50% absent calls were excluded, as calculated using the panp package from Bioconductor. Finally, the ComBat library in R was used to correct for batch effect (Johnson et al. 2007).	16569		n/a							Total RNA was collected using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat No. 74134) 48 hours after transient transfection of HEK293T cells.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							wtfsh_2:44ug.		wild type		GSM546592					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C; 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t466fsh_2:45.7ug.		mutant hek293_t466		GSM546591					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t466ns_3:53.5ug.		mutant hek293_t466		GSM546596					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t469ns_1:17.4ug.		mutant hek_t469		GSM546579					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	23-12-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t466fsh_3:43ug.		mutant hek293_t466		GSM546584					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							wtfsh_3:85ug.		wild type		GSM546590					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C; 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							wtns_3:92.3ug.		wild type		GSM546595					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C; 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

The transcript probe set intensities were background-corrected, adjusted for non-specific binding and quantile normalized with the GCRMA algorithm (Wu, 2006). Probe sets with more than 6 of the 11 probes mapping ambiguously to the genome were discarded, as were probe sets that mapped to multiple genes. We then collected all probe sets matching a given gene, and we selected for further analysis the RefSeq transcript with median 3'UTR length corresponding to that gene. In total 16,063 transcripts were identified. The log-intensity of probe sets mapping to the gene were then averaged to obtain the expression level per RefSeq transcript. The changes of transcript abundances were computed as the logarithm of the ratio of transcript expression in the cocktails of siRNA treated samples and mock-transfected cells.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							wtns_2:74.5ug.		wild type		GSM546594					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C; 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t469fsh_2:25.7ug.		mutant hek_t469		GSM546588					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	23-12-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							wtfsh_1:70.6ug.		wild type		GSM546583					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C; 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							wtns_1:31.4ug.		wild type		GSM546586					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C; 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t466ns_1:62.8ug.		mutant hek293_t466		GSM546580					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.

They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered -arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit -arrestins and signal through them.							t466fsh_1:48ug.		mutant hek293_t466		GSM546589					cell culture/primary cell - MEM (PAA Laboratory GmbH) + Fetal Bovin Serum 10% + Penicilin and Streptomycin 1% 37C, 5% C02	20-10-09		labelled extract quantity: 15ug					Biotin	labelling Biotin direct, amplification=yes, cRNA 20 ug.
